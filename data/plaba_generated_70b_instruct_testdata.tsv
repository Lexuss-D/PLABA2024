Q1	A9	28659501	Diet and exercise in the management of obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease risk	1	Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality.	Sleep apnea, a condition where breathing stops during sleep, is linked to a higher risk of heart disease and related deaths.
Q1	A9	28659501	Diet and exercise in the management of obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease risk	2	It is accepted that OSA and obesity commonly coexist.	It is well-known that sleep apnea and obesity often occur together.
Q1	A9	28659501	Diet and exercise in the management of obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease risk	3	The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends dietary-induced weight loss and exercise as lifestyle treatment options for OSA.	The American Academy of Sleep Medicine suggests losing weight through diet and exercising regularly as ways to help manage sleep apnea.
Q1	A9	28659501	Diet and exercise in the management of obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease risk	4	However, most clinical trials upon which this recommendation is based have focused on establishing the effectiveness of calorie-restricted, often low-fat diets for improving OSA severity, whereas less attention has been given to the means through which weight loss is achieved (e.g. altered dietary quality) or whether diet or exercise mediates the associations between reduced weight, improved OSA severity and the CVD substrate.	Most studies that led to this recommendation looked at how low-calorie, low-fat diets can help improve sleep apnea symptoms. However, they didn't focus much on how people lost weight (such as by eating healthier) or whether it was diet or exercise that helped improve sleep apnea and heart health when people lost weight.
Q1	A9	28659501	Diet and exercise in the management of obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease risk	5	The current evidence suggests that the benefits of a low-carbohydrate or Mediterranean diet in overweight and obese individuals go beyond the recognised benefits of weight reduction.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:New research shows that eating a low-carb or Mediterranean diet can help overweight and obese people in ways that go beyond just losing weight.I made the following changes:* Changed ""current evidence suggests"" to ""new research shows"" to make the language more accessible and easier to understand.* Replaced ""recognised benefits of weight reduction"" with ""just losing weight"" to simplify the phrase and make it more relatable.* Used simpler vocabulary throughout the sentence to make it easier to comprehend."
Q1	A9	28659501	Diet and exercise in the management of obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease risk	6	In addition, exercise has an independent protective effect on vascular health, which may counter the increased oxidative stress, inflammation and sympathetic activation that occur in OSA patients.	Exercise also has a separate benefit for blood vessel health, which can help balance out the increased stress, inflammation, and other negative effects that often occur in people with sleep apnea (OSA).
Q1	A9	28659501	Diet and exercise in the management of obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease risk	7	This review aims to expand our understanding of the effects of diet and exercise on OSA and associated CVD complications, and sets the stage for continued research designed to explore optimal lifestyle strategies for reducing the CVD burden in OSA patients.	"This review aims to better understand how diet and exercise affect sleep apnea and related heart problems, and prepare for more research on the best lifestyle changes to reduce heart issues in sleep apnea patients.Note: I replaced ""expand our understanding"" with ""better understand"" for simplicity, and ""OSA"" with ""sleep apnea"" for clarity. I also rephrased ""sets the stage"" to ""prepare for"" to make it more straightforward.

Q1	A10	28901030	Treating OSA: Current and emerging therapies beyond CPAP	1	Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the standard treatment for moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) is the usual treatment for people who have moderate to severe sleep apnea, a condition where breathing stops and starts during sleep.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand, replacing the technical term ""obstructive sleep apnoea"" with a more descriptive phrase ""a condition where breathing stops and starts during sleep""."
Q1	A10	28901030	Treating OSA: Current and emerging therapies beyond CPAP	2	However, adherence to CPAP is limited and non-CPAP therapies are frequently explored.	Many people have trouble sticking to CPAP treatment, so other options are often considered.
Q1	A10	28901030	Treating OSA: Current and emerging therapies beyond CPAP	3	Oral appliance (OA) therapy is currently widely used for the treatment of snoring, mild, moderate and severe OSA.	Oral appliance (OA) therapy is a common treatment for snoring and sleep apnea (a condition where a person stops breathing for short periods during sleep), ranging from mild to severe cases.(Note: I've rephrased the sentence for clarity and defined OSA as sleep apnea for better understanding.)
Q1	A10	28901030	Treating OSA: Current and emerging therapies beyond CPAP	4	The most commonly used and studied OA consists of a maxillary and mandibular splint which hold the lower jaw forward during sleep.	The most commonly used and studied Oral Appliance (OA) is made up of two parts that fit on the upper and lower jaws. These parts work together to keep the lower jaw in a forward position while the person sleeps.
Q1	A10	28901030	Treating OSA: Current and emerging therapies beyond CPAP	5	The efficacy of OA is inferior to CPAP; however, the effectiveness as measured by sleepiness, quality of life, endothelial function and blood pressure is similar likely due to higher acceptance and subjective adherence.	The effectiveness of Oral Appliances (OA) is not as good as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in some ways, but they have similar results in reducing sleepiness, improving quality of life, and lowering blood pressure, likely because more people accept and use OA consistently.
Q1	A10	28901030	Treating OSA: Current and emerging therapies beyond CPAP	6	Upper airway stimulation augments neural drive by unilaterally stimulating the hypoglossal nerve.	"Upper airway stimulation works by sending signals to the nerve that controls the tongue, helping it to move and open the airway.Explanation: - I replaced ""augments neural drive"" with ""works by sending signals"" to make it simpler and more understandable.- I explained ""unilaterally stimulating the hypoglossal nerve"" as ""sending signals to the nerve that controls the tongue"", since ""hypoglossal nerve"" is a rare term that might be unfamiliar to non-medical people."
Q1	A10	28901030	Treating OSA: Current and emerging therapies beyond CPAP	7	The Stimulation Therapy for Apnea Reduction (STAR) study enrolled 126 patients and demonstrated a 68% reduction in OSA severity.	"The STAR study involved 126 patients and showed a 68% decrease in the severity of sleep apnea.Note: I simplified the sentence by rephrasing ""Stimulation Therapy for Apnea Reduction (STAR) study"" to just ""STAR study"" for brevity, and also replaced ""OSA"" (a rare term) with ""sleep apnea"" (a more commonly known term)."
Q1	A10	28901030	Treating OSA: Current and emerging therapies beyond CPAP	8	A high upfront cost and variable response are the main limitations.	The main drawbacks are the high initial cost and the fact that it may not work the same for everyone.

"The Runx2 gene is controlled in several ways, including how its information is copied, used to make a protein, and changed after it's made.Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and easier to understand, avoiding technical terms like ""transcription,"" ""translation,"" and ""post-translational modification."""
Q2	A1	19734454	Post-translational Regulation of Runx2 in Bone and Cartilage	5	Furthermore, Runx2 is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions, most of which either activate or repress transcription of target genes.	"Runx2 is a protein that interacts with many other proteins, and these interactions can either turn on or turn off the production of specific genes.(Note: I rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and easier to understand, avoiding technical jargon. I also removed the word ""transcription"" and replaced it with ""production"" to make it more accessible to a general audience.)"
Q2	A1	19734454	Post-translational Regulation of Runx2 in Bone and Cartilage	6	In this review, we discuss expression of Runx2 during development as well as the post-translational regulation of Runx2 through modification by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation.	"Here's the simplified version:In this review, we'll talk about how Runx2 is produced in the body as it grows and develops, and how its activity is controlled by adding different chemical tags to it.Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:* ""expression of Runx2 during development"" is rephrased as ""how Runx2 is produced in the body as it grows and develops"" to make it more accessible.* ""post-translational regulation"" is a complex term that refers to the ways in which a protein's activity is controlled after it's been produced. I simplified this by saying ""how its activity is controlled"".* ""modification by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation"" refers to specific chemical processes that add tags to a protein. I simplified this by saying ""adding different chemical tags to it""."
Q2	A2	24222232	RUNX2 mutations in cleidocranial dysplasia	1	The runt-related transcription factor 2 gene (RUNX2), which is also known as CBFA1, is a master regulatory gene in bone formation.	The RUNX2 gene, also called CBFA1, is a key gene that helps control how bones are formed.

"Here's a simplified version of the provided text:Gemcitabine (GEM) is a medicine used to treat advanced pancreatic cancer. It works by slowing down the growth of cancer cells. However, it doesn't work very well for many patients.I made the following changes:- Replaced ""cytidine nucleoside analogue"" with a simpler explanation that it's a medicine, as the exact chemical nature of the compound might not be relevant to a general patient audience.- Explained ""ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor"" as ""slowing down the growth of cancer cells"", as the technical term might be unfamiliar to non-medical professionals.- Changed ""primary option"" to ""used to treat"", to make the sentence more straightforward and easier to understand.- Simplified ""clinical efficacy is extremely limited"" to ""doesn't work very well for many patients"", to convey the same information in a more accessible way."
Q2	A3	29558908	Impact of RUNX2 on drug-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells with p53 mutations	3	This unfavorable clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer patients is at least in part attributable to their poor response to anti-cancer drugs such as GEM.	One reason pancreatic cancer patients don't do well is because they don't respond well to certain cancer medicines like GEM.
Q2	A3	29558908	Impact of RUNX2 on drug-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells with p53 mutations	4	Thus, it is urgent to understand the precise molecular basis behind the drug-resistant property of pancreatic cancer and also to develop a novel strategy to overcome this deadly disease.	We need to understand exactly why pancreatic cancer doesn't respond to some medicines and find a new way to fight this disease.
Q2	A3	29558908	Impact of RUNX2 on drug-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells with p53 mutations	5	Review: Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that p53 mutations contribute to the acquisition and/or maintenance of drug-resistant property of pancreatic cancer.	Research has shown that changes in a specific gene called p53 may help pancreatic cancer cells become resistant to treatment.
Q2	A3	29558908	Impact of RUNX2 on drug-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells with p53 mutations	6	Indeed, certain p53 mutants render pancreatic cancer cells much more resistant to GEM, implying that p53 mutation is one of the critical determinants of GEM sensitivity.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Indeed, some changes in the p53 gene make pancreatic cancer cells less responsive to a certain treatment (GEM), suggesting that the p53 gene plays a crucial role in how well this treatment works.Or, in even simpler terms:Changes in the p53 gene can make pancreatic cancer cells less sensitive to a certain treatment, which means the p53 gene affects how well the treatment works.I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand, replacing the term ""render"" with ""make"" and ""determinants"" with ""plays a crucial role"" or ""affects how well""."
Q2	A3	29558908	Impact of RUNX2 on drug-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells with p53 mutations	7	Intriguingly, runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) is expressed at higher level in numerous human cancers such as pancreatic cancer and osteosarcoma, indicating that, in addition to its pro-osteogenic role, RUNX2 has a pro-oncogenic potential.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Interestingly, a protein called RUNX2 is found in higher amounts in many types of human cancers, such as pancreatic cancer and bone cancer. This suggests that RUNX2 not only helps build bones but also may contribute to the development of cancer.I made the following changes:1. Rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise.2. Replaced the term ""runt-related transcription factor 2"" with ""a protein called RUNX2"" to make it more accessible to non-experts.3. Replaced the term ""pro-osteogenic role"" with ""helps build bones"" to explain its function in simpler terms.4. Replaced the term ""pro-oncogenic potential"" with ""may contribute to the development of cancer"" to explain its possible role in cancer in simpler terms."
Q2	A3	29558908	Impact of RUNX2 on drug-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells with p53 mutations	8	Moreover, a growing body of evidence implies that a variety of miRNAs suppress malignant phenotypes of pancreatic cancer cells including drug resistance through the down-regulation of RUNX2.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Moreover, recent studies suggest that certain small molecules called miRNAs can help stop the growth of pancreatic cancer cells, including their ability to resist drugs, by reducing the activity of a protein called RUNX2.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand. Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:* ""a growing body of evidence"" became ""recent studies"" to make the language more concise and accessible.* ""implies"" became ""suggest"" to use a more common and straightforward verb.* ""miRNAs"" is a technical term, so I added a brief explanation that it refers to ""small molecules"" to help non-experts understand.* ""suppress malignant phenotypes"" became ""help stop the growth"" to use more straightforward language.* ""down-regulation"" became ""reducing the activity"" to use a more common and accessible phrase.* I left ""RUNX2"" as is, but in a real-world conversation, I might explain that it's a type of protein involved in cancer growth."
Q2	A3	29558908	Impact of RUNX2 on drug-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells with p53 mutations	9	Recently, we have found for the first time that forced depletion of RUNX2 significantly increases GEM sensitivity of p53-null as well as p53-mutated pancreatic cancer cells through the stimulation of p53 family TAp63/TAp73-dependent cell death pathway.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Recently, we discovered that removing a specific protein called RUNX2 makes pancreatic cancer cells more responsive to a certain treatment, especially in cells that have faulty or missing p53 genes. This happens because the treatment triggers a pathway that helps kill these cancer cells.I made the following changes:* Broke down the long sentence into simpler phrases* Replaced technical terms with simpler explanations (e.g., ""forced depletion"" became ""removing"", ""GEM sensitivity"" became ""responsive to a certain treatment"")* Defined the protein ""RUNX2"" as ""a specific protein"" to make it more accessible to non-experts* Explained the concept of ""p53-null"" and ""p53-mutated"" as ""faulty or missing p53 genes"" to make it clearer* Simplified the phrase ""p53 family TAp63/TAp73-dependent cell death pathway"" to ""a pathway that helps kill these cancer cells"" to focus on the main idea."

Q2	A4	17290219	Disease mutations in RUNX1 and RUNX2 create nonfunctional, dominant-negative, or hypomorphic alleles	4	Most hematopoietic missense mutations in Runx1 involve DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain, whereas the majority of CCD mutations in Runx2 are predicted to impair CBFbeta binding or the Runt domain structure.	Most changes in the Runx1 gene that affect blood cell production occur in areas where the gene directly interacts with DNA, specifically in the Runt domain. In contrast, most changes in the Runx2 gene are expected to disrupt its connection with another protein called CBFbeta or alter the structure of the Runt domain.
Q2	A4	17290219	Disease mutations in RUNX1 and RUNX2 create nonfunctional, dominant-negative, or hypomorphic alleles	5	We introduced different classes of missense mutations into Runx1 and characterized their effects on DNA and CBFbeta binding by the Runt domain, and on Runx1 function in vivo.	"Here's the simplified text:Original: We introduced different classes of missense mutations into Runx1 and characterized their effects on DNA and CBFbeta binding by the Runt domain, and on Runx1 function in vivo.Simplified:We made changes to the Runx1 gene and studied how these changes affected its ability to bind to DNA and work properly in living organisms.Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:- ""introduced different classes of missense mutations"" was simplified to ""made changes"" to make the language more accessible.- ""characterized their effects"" was simplified to ""studied how these changes affected"" to make the sentence more straightforward.- ""on DNA and CBFbeta binding by the Runt domain"" was simplified to ""its ability to bind to DNA"" to remove technical jargon. The term ""Runt domain"" was removed as it's a specialized term that may not be familiar to non-experts.- ""on Runx1 function in vivo"" was simplified to ""work properly in living organisms"" to make the language more concise and easy to understand."
Q2	A4	17290219	Disease mutations in RUNX1 and RUNX2 create nonfunctional, dominant-negative, or hypomorphic alleles	6	Mutations involving DNA-contacting residues severely inactivate Runx1 function, whereas mutations that affect CBFbeta binding but not DNA binding result in hypomorphic alleles.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Changes in the DNA-contacting parts of the Runx1 gene can completely stop it from working. However, changes that affect how it binds to another protein (CBFbeta), but not how it binds to DNA, can lead to a partially working version of the gene.Note: I replaced ""inactivate"" with ""stop it from working"", ""hypomorphic alleles"" with ""partially working version of the gene"", and ""mutations involving"" with ""changes in"" to make the sentence more accessible to a non-technical audience."
Q2	A4	17290219	Disease mutations in RUNX1 and RUNX2 create nonfunctional, dominant-negative, or hypomorphic alleles	7	We conclude that hypomorphic RUNX2 alleles can cause CCD, whereas hematopoietic disease requires more severely inactivating RUNX1 mutations.	"We found that mild changes in the RUNX2 gene can lead to a condition called Cleidocranial Dysplasia (CCD), while more severe changes in the RUNX1 gene are needed to cause blood-related diseases.Note: I've rephrased the sentence for clarity and replaced technical terms with simpler language. Here's a breakdown of the changes:- ""Hypomorphic"" is a technical term that means a mild change in a gene, so I've replaced it with ""mild changes"".- ""RUNX2 alleles"" is a technical term that refers to a specific version of the RUNX2 gene, so I've simplified it to ""the RUNX2 gene"".- ""Hematopoietic disease"" is a technical term that refers to blood-related diseases, so I've replaced it with ""blood-related diseases"".- ""More severely inactivating RUNX1 mutations"" is a technical term that refers to more significant changes in the RUNX1 gene, so I've simplified it to ""more severe changes in the RUNX1 gene"".- ""Cleidocranial Dysplasia (CCD)"" is a technical term that refers to a specific condition, so I've added a brief explanation to help non-experts understand the context."

Q2	A9	32385263	A RUNX2 stabilization pathway mediates physiologic and pathologic bone formation	1	The osteoblast differentiation capacity of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) must be tightly regulated, as inadequate bone formation results in low bone mass and skeletal fragility, and over-exuberant osteogenesis results in heterotopic ossification (HO) of soft tissues.	The body's ability to form bone cells needs to be carefully controlled. If it's not working properly, it can lead to weak bones or, on the other hand, extra bone growth in areas where it shouldn't be, like in soft tissues.
Q2	A9	32385263	A RUNX2 stabilization pathway mediates physiologic and pathologic bone formation	2	RUNX2 is essential for tuning this balance, but the mechanisms of posttranslational control of RUNX2 remain to be fully elucidated.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:RUNX2 is crucial for maintaining this balance, but we still need to fully understand how it's controlled after being produced.Explanation:- ""Tuning this balance"" has been simplified to ""maintaining this balance"" for easier understanding.- ""Posttranslational control"" is a complex term, so it's been rephrased to ""how it's controlled after being produced"", which is more straightforward.- ""Remain to be fully elucidated"" has been simplified to ""we still need to fully understand"" to make the sentence more accessible."
Q2	A9	32385263	A RUNX2 stabilization pathway mediates physiologic and pathologic bone formation	3	Here, we identify that a CK2/HAUSP pathway is a key regulator of RUNX2 stability, as Casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates RUNX2, recruiting the deubiquitinase herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP), which stabilizes RUNX2 by diverting it away from ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:We found that a pathway involving two proteins, CK2 and HAUSP, helps control the stability of another protein called RUNX2. This happens when CK2 adds a phosphate group to RUNX2, which then attracts HAUSP. HAUSP helps keep RUNX2 stable by preventing it from being broken down by the cell's waste removal system.I replaced or simplified the following terms:- CK2/HAUSP pathway: a pathway involving two proteins, CK2 and HAUSP (explained in simpler terms)- Casein kinase 2 (CK2): a protein (omitted the full name for simplicity)- Phosphorylates: adds a phosphate group to (explained in simpler terms)- Deubiquitinase: a protein that removes ubiquitin (explained in simpler terms)- Herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP): HAUSP (omitted the full name for simplicity)- Ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation: the cell's waste removal system (explained in simpler terms)
Q2	A9	32385263	A RUNX2 stabilization pathway mediates physiologic and pathologic bone formation	4	This pathway is important for both the commitment of SSCs to osteoprogenitors and their subsequent maturation.	This pathway plays a crucial role in two key steps for SSCs (a type of cell): first, helping them decide to become bone cells, and then, helping them fully develop into those cells.(Note: I assumed SSCs might be unfamiliar to non-experts, so I added a brief explanation in parentheses.)
Q2	A9	32385263	A RUNX2 stabilization pathway mediates physiologic and pathologic bone formation	5	This CK2/HAUSP/RUNX2 pathway is also necessary for HO, as its inhibition blocked HO in multiple models.	"Simplified:This CK2/HAUSP/RUNX2 pathway is also important for Heterotopic Ossification (HO), because when it's stopped, HO is blocked in many different models.(Note: I replaced ""HO"" with its full form ""Heterotopic Ossification"" for clarity, and rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and easier to understand.)"
Q2	A9	32385263	A RUNX2 stabilization pathway mediates physiologic and pathologic bone formation	6	Collectively, active deubiquitination of RUNX2 is required for bone formation and this CK2/HAUSP deubiquitination pathway offers therapeutic opportunities for disorders of inappropriate mineralization.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""Overall, a process called deubiquitination is necessary for bone growth. This process involves the interaction of two proteins, CK2 and HAUSP, and understanding it could lead to new treatments for bone disorders.""I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand, replacing technical terms with simpler explanations:- ""Collectively"" became ""Overall""- ""Active deubiquitination"" was explained as ""a process called deubiquitination""- ""RUNX2"" was not essential to the main idea, so it was removed- ""CK2/HAUSP deubiquitination pathway"" was explained as ""the interaction of two proteins, CK2 and HAUSP""- ""Therapeutic opportunities"" became ""new treatments""- ""Disorders of inappropriate mineralization"" was explained as ""bone disorders"""
Q2	A10	32360898	Gain-of-function variants and overexpression of RUNX2 in patients with nonsyndromic midline craniosynostosis	1	Craniosynostosis (CS), the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, is a relatively common congenital anomaly, occurring in 3-5 per 10,000 live births.	Craniosynostosis (CS) is a birth condition where the bones in a baby's skull join together too early. This condition affects 3-5 out of every 10,000 babies born.
Q2	A10	32360898	Gain-of-function variants and overexpression of RUNX2 in patients with nonsyndromic midline craniosynostosis	2	Nonsyndromic CS (NCS) accounts for up to 80% of all CS cases, yet the genetic factors contributing to the disorder remain largely unknown.	Most cases of craniosynostosis (about 80%) are not part of any other condition, but the genetic reasons for this disorder are still not well understood.(Note: I've assumed CS stands for craniosynostosis, a condition where the bones of the skull fuse together prematurely. If CS stands for something else, please let me know and I'll be happy to adjust the simplification accordingly.)

"Here's the simplified version:The RUNX2 gene is important for bone and skull growth. It's a likely candidate for causing certain skull conditions, as changes in this gene have been found in patients with those conditions.Explanation:- ""Encoding a transcription factor"" is simplified to ""important for bone and skull growth"" to make the language more accessible.- ""CS candidate gene"" is rephrased as ""likely candidate for causing certain skull conditions"" to provide clarity and context.- ""Copy number variations of this gene locus"" is simplified to ""changes in this gene"" to use more common terminology.- ""Syndromic craniosynostosis"" is not directly explained, but the context implies it's a skull condition, so it's left as is. However, if needed, it could be explained further: ""a condition where the bones of the skull grow together too early."""
Q2	A10	32360898	Gain-of-function variants and overexpression of RUNX2 in patients with nonsyndromic midline craniosynostosis	4	In the present study, we aimed to characterize RUNX2 to better understand its role in the genetic etiology and in the molecular mechanisms underlying midline suture ossification in NCS.	In this study, we wanted to learn more about RUNX2 to understand how it affects the development of bones in the skull, specifically the fusion of bones in the middle part of the skull in people with craniosynostosis (NCS).
Q2	A10	32360898	Gain-of-function variants and overexpression of RUNX2 in patients with nonsyndromic midline craniosynostosis	5	We report four nonsynonymous variants, one intronic variant and one 18 bp in-frame deletion in RUNX2 not found in our study control population.	We found four changes in the RUNX2 gene that affect how it works, one change in a non-coding area, and one small deletion of 18 DNA building blocks that doesn't disrupt the gene's function, which were not present in the people we used as a comparison group.
Q2	A10	32360898	Gain-of-function variants and overexpression of RUNX2 in patients with nonsyndromic midline craniosynostosis	6	Significant difference in allele frequency (AF) for the deletion variant RUNX2 p.Ala84-Ala89del (ClinVar 257,095; dbSNP rs11498192) was observed in our sagittal NCS cohort when compared to the general population (P = 1.28 × 10-6), suggesting a possible role in the etiology of NCS.	"We found a notable difference in the frequency of a specific genetic variation, called RUNX2, in our group of sagittal NCS patients compared to the general population. This difference suggests that this genetic variation might play a role in causing NCS.Note: I replaced ""allele frequency (AF)"" with ""frequency of a specific genetic variation"" to make it simpler, and ""etiology of NCS"" with ""causing NCS"" to make it more straightforward. I also removed the specific numbers and database references (e.g. ClinVar, dbSNP) as they are not essential for understanding the main point of the sentence."

Q4	A3	35547781	Efficacy of ICS versus Non-ICS Combination Therapy in COPD: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials	4	Overall, the number of patients experiencing moderate/severe exacerbations was significantly lower for ICS-containing combination therapy versus non-ICS therapy (RR: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80-0.93]).	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Fewer patients had moderate to severe asthma attacks when taking medication that included ICS, compared to those who didn't take ICS (the risk was 14% lower).
Q4	A3	35547781	Efficacy of ICS versus Non-ICS Combination Therapy in COPD: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials	5	The annual rate of exacerbations was also significantly reduced by 22% (0.78 [0.72-0.86]) with ICS-containing versus non-ICS therapy.	The yearly rate of flare-ups decreased by 22% when using ICS-containing treatment compared to non-ICS treatment.Note: ICS stands for Inhaled Corticosteroids, which are commonly used to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma.
Q4	A3	35547781	Efficacy of ICS versus Non-ICS Combination Therapy in COPD: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials	6	The annual rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation was reduced by 31% versus non-ICS therapy (0.69 [0.54-0.88]); similar reduction was observed for exacerbations requiring oral steroids (0.69 [0.66-0.73]).	The yearly rate of severe episodes that required hospitalization was 31% lower with ICS therapy compared to without it. A similar decrease was seen in episodes that required steroid medication.
Q4	A3	35547781	Efficacy of ICS versus Non-ICS Combination Therapy in COPD: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials	7	Overall, the effect on trough FEV1 was comparable between ICS-containing and non-ICS therapies (follow-up: 6-52 weeks); however, a significant improvement in lung function (trough FEV1) was observed for ICS/LABA versus LABA (MD: +0.04 L [0.03-0.05]) and ICS/LABA/LAMA versus LAMA (MD: +0.09 L [0.05-0.13]) regimens.	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:The effect on lung function was similar between two types of treatments (studied over 6-52 weeks). However, lung function improved more when using a combination of three medicines (ICS, LABA, and LAMA) compared to using just one or two of them.
Q4	A3	35547781	Efficacy of ICS versus Non-ICS Combination Therapy in COPD: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials	8	In addition, a significant improvement in QoL was observed with ICS-containing versus non-ICS therapy (MD in SGRQ score: -0.90 [-1.50, -0.31]).	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""In addition, patients reported a better quality of life when taking medication that included ICS compared to those who didn't (their symptoms improved by a significant amount).""Here's a breakdown of the changes made:* ""QoL"" is an abbreviation for ""Quality of Life,"" which is a common medical term, but may not be familiar to non-medical readers. It's been rephrased to ""quality of life"" for clarity.* ""ICS-containing versus non-ICS therapy"" is a complex phrase that's been rephrased to ""medication that included ICS compared to those who didn't."" ICS is likely an abbreviation for ""Inhaled Corticosteroids,"" which is a type of medication. It's been left as ""ICS"" since it's a specific medical term, but the phrase has been rephrased to make it clearer.* ""MD in SGRQ score"" is a statistical term that's been rephrased to ""their symptoms improved by a significant amount."" The SGRQ score is a measure of symptoms, and the MD (mean difference) is a statistical term that's been simplified to make it easier to understand.

Q4	A6	35207460	The Impact of 52-Week Single Inhaler Device Triple Therapy versus Dual Therapy on the Mortality of COPD Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials	10	In addition, patients receiving ICS/LABA/LAMA FDC therapy had less moderate or severe exacerbations compared with the dual therapy groups (RR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.73-0.80, p < 0.001 for LABA/LAMA; RR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.78-0.90, p < 0.001 for ICS/LABA).	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Patients taking a combination of three medicines (ICS, LABA, and LAMA) had fewer moderate to severe asthma attacks compared to those taking only two medicines (either LABA and LAMA or ICS and LABA).
Q4	A6	35207460	The Impact of 52-Week Single Inhaler Device Triple Therapy versus Dual Therapy on the Mortality of COPD Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials	11	By contrast, the risk of pneumonia in the ICS/LABA/LAMA FDC group was higher than in the LABA/LAMA group (RR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.21-1.68, p < 0.001).	Simplified:Compared to the LABA/LAMA group, the ICS/LABA/LAMA FDC group had a higher risk of getting pneumonia (about 43% more likely).Note: I replaced the technical terms with simpler language and removed the statistical jargon (RR, CI, p-value) to make the sentence more accessible to a general audience.
Q4	A6	35207460	The Impact of 52-Week Single Inhaler Device Triple Therapy versus Dual Therapy on the Mortality of COPD Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials	12	In conclusion, ICS/LABA/LAMA FDC therapy could help improve the clinical outcomes of patients with COPD.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Using a combination of three medicines (ICS, LABA, and LAMA) together can help improve the health outcomes of patients with a lung disease called COPD.Note: I defined the acronym ""FDC"" as ""a combination of three medicines"" for clarity, and also explained ""COPD"" as ""a lung disease"" for better understanding."
Q4	A6	35207460	The Impact of 52-Week Single Inhaler Device Triple Therapy versus Dual Therapy on the Mortality of COPD Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials	13	However, triple therapy could increase the risk of pneumonia in comparison with LABA/LAMA dual therapy.	Taking three medications together might increase the risk of getting pneumonia compared to taking just two medications.
Q4	A7	35068929	Beyond Dual Bronchodilation - Triple Therapy, When and Why	1	Although pharmacological treatment of COPD is codified in different guidelines and strategy documents, there is abundant evidence of discrepancy between what they suggest and what health professionals prescribe, especially in low-risk groups where there is widespread overprescription of triple therapy.	There are guidelines for treating COPD with medication, but often what doctors prescribe doesn't match these guidelines, especially for patients who are at low risk, where too many are given a combination of three medicines when they may not need them.
Q4	A7	35068929	Beyond Dual Bronchodilation - Triple Therapy, When and Why	2	It is therefore necessary to clarify when the use of triple therapy is indicated in COPD patients and when it is preferable to maintain treatment with dual bronchodilation.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""It's essential to know when to use a combination of three medications for COPD patients and when two medications are enough.""I made the following changes:* ""Clarify"" was replaced with ""know"" to make the sentence more straightforward.* ""Triple therapy"" was rephrased as ""a combination of three medications"" to avoid using technical terms.* ""Dual bronchodilation"" was rephrased as ""two medications"" to make the sentence more concise and easy to understand.* The sentence structure was simplified to improve clarity and readability."
Q4	A7	35068929	Beyond Dual Bronchodilation - Triple Therapy, When and Why	3	In this article, we discuss our views based on our experience and what is reported in the literature and try to give answers to these two questions.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:In this article, we share our thoughts based on our experience and what others have reported, and try to answer two important questions.I made the following changes to simplify the sentence:- Changed ""discuss our views"" to ""share our thoughts"" to make it more conversational and easier to understand.- Replaced ""what is reported in the literature"" with ""what others have reported"" to make it more accessible to a broader audience.- Changed ""try to give answers"" to ""try to answer"" to make the sentence more concise."
Q4	A7	35068929	Beyond Dual Bronchodilation - Triple Therapy, When and Why	4	The evidence generated by pivotal RCTs supports the use of triple therapy in patients who present for the first time and have severe airway obstruction, are symptomatic, have had frequent moderate or severe exacerbations in the previous year, and have peripheral eosinophilia.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Research shows that using a combination of three treatments is helpful for patients who have severe breathing problems, noticeable symptoms, and frequent worsening of their condition, especially if they have a certain type of high white blood cell count.Note: I've replaced ""pivotal RCTs"" with ""research"" to make it more accessible, and ""peripheral eosinophilia"" with ""a certain type of high white blood cell count"" to provide a concise definition. I've also rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand."
Q4	A7	35068929	Beyond Dual Bronchodilation - Triple Therapy, When and Why	5	However, it is difficult to determine whether step-up is useful in all other cases because the available data are quite conflicting.	We don't have enough clear information to know if the step-up approach is helpful in all other situations, as the existing data gives mixed results.
Q4	A7	35068929	Beyond Dual Bronchodilation - Triple Therapy, When and Why	6	It is likely that the inconsistency in the information generated by the various available studies may explain the prescribing behaviour of many physicians who do not adhere to recommendations of guidelines and strategies.	Different studies have provided conflicting information, which may be why many doctors don't follow the recommended treatment guidelines.
Q4	A7	35068929	Beyond Dual Bronchodilation - Triple Therapy, When and Why	7	However, it is necessary to establish whether and when the addition of an ICS to the LAMA/LABA combination is effective, to determine whether triple therapy can induce an additional clinical benefit over dual bronchodilation, irrespective of a preventive effect on COPD exacerbations, to establish its value, and to examine whether cost differences can support the use of triple therapy over combined LAMA/LABA therapy in real life.	"Here's a simplified version of the text:""We need to find out if adding a certain medicine (ICS) to the usual combination of two other medicines (LAMA/LABA) helps patients more. We want to know if using three medicines together is better than using just two, and if it can prevent severe episodes of the disease (COPD). We also want to see if the extra cost of using three medicines is worth it in real-life situations.""I made the following changes:* Broke down the long sentence into shorter, simpler sentences* Replaced technical terms with simpler explanations (e.g. ""induce an additional clinical benefit"" became ""helps patients more"")* Removed jargon (e.g. ""irrespective of a preventive effect on COPD exacerbations"" became ""prevent severe episodes of the disease"")* Used more conversational language to make the text easier to understand."
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	1	Supportive care and pharmacological treatment can improve the quality of life of people with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who cope on a daily basis with substantial physical, psychological, social and spiritual morbidity.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:For people with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which causes significant physical, emotional, and social challenges, supportive care and medication can greatly improve their quality of life.Or, if you'd like to break down the medical term:For people with severe COPD (a condition that makes it hard to breathe), which causes significant physical, emotional, and social challenges, supportive care and medication can greatly improve their quality of life.
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	2	Smoking cessation is the only intervention that reduces the rate of progression of COPD, but evidence-based drug treatments and non-pharmacological strategies can relieve symptoms and reduce the impact of exacerbations.	Quitting smoking is the best way to slow down the progression of COPD. However, there are also effective medications and non-drug treatments that can help alleviate symptoms and minimize the severity of flare-ups.
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	3	People with severe COPD live with increasingly troublesome breathlessness and other symptoms such as fatigue, pain, sputum production and weight loss.	"People with severe COPD experience worsening breathing difficulties and other symptoms like tiredness, pain, coughing up mucus, and losing weight.(Note: I've kept the term ""COPD"" as it's a relatively well-known abbreviation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, but if needed, it can be expanded for further clarity.)"
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	4	As breathlessness increases, treatment is stepped up from short-acting to long-acting bronchodilators supplemented by non-pharmacological interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation.	As breathing difficulties worsen, treatment is adjusted from fast-acting to long-lasting medications, and also includes non-medication approaches like breathing exercises and physical therapy to improve lung function.
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	5	Opiates relieve breathlessness, and referral to a multidisciplinary breathlessness service is an option for those with intractable symptoms.	Opiates can help with shortness of breath. For people with severe symptoms, we can refer them to a team of specialists who focus on helping with breathing difficulties.
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	6	Other smoking-related conditions, such as coronary heart disease and lung cancer as well as depression and anxiety are common and should be treated with conventional pharmacotherapy.	Smoking is also linked to other health issues, like heart disease, lung cancer, depression, and anxiety, which should be treated with standard medication.
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	7	Acute exacerbations become more frequent and more severe as the disease reaches end-stage.	As the disease gets worse, the sudden worsening of symptoms happens more often and is more serious.
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	8	Inhaled corticosteroids in combination with long-acting bronchodilators can reduce the frequency of exacerbations, and supported self-management aims to facilitate timely treatment of deterioration.	"Here's the simplified version:Using certain medications that you breathe in, along with long-lasting medicines to open airways, can help reduce the number of severe episodes. Also, managing your condition yourself with support can help you get treatment quickly when your symptoms worsen.I replaced the term ""inhaled corticosteroids"" with ""certain medications that you breathe in"" to make it more understandable, and rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise."
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	9	Palliative care services have traditionally been predicated on identifying people with end-stage disease-a model that does not resonate with the unpredictable, relapsing trajectory of COPD.	Palliative care usually focuses on helping people with diseases that cannot be cured, but this approach doesn't work well for COPD, a condition with unpredictable symptoms that can get better or worse at any time.
Q4	A8	28220381	Pharmacological Management of People Living with End-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	10	Approaches to care that promote a flexible approach to palliation alongside curative care could do much to improve the burden of living with severe COPD.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence: Approaches to care that combine helping with symptoms and trying to cure the condition can greatly improve the quality of life for people with severe COPD.Explanation:- ""Flexible approach to palliation"" is rephrased as ""helping with symptoms"" to make it more straightforward.- ""Curative care"" is rephrased as ""trying to cure the condition"" for clarity.- ""Burden of living"" is rephrased as ""quality of life"" to use more common and relatable terms.- ""Severe COPD"" remains the same, but if needed, COPD can be defined as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, a lung condition that makes breathing difficult."

We divided them into two groups of 30 patients each to compare two treatments: GFF and TFF.
Q4	A9	35707484	Comparative Study on the effectiveness of Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol versus Tiotropium/Formoterol in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	5	The primary outcome was to demonstrate non-inferiority between the two groups concerning FEV1 for 12 weeks.	"The main goal was to show that one group wasn't significantly worse than the other in terms of lung function (FEV1) over a 12-week period.Here's a breakdown of the simplification:- ""primary outcome"" is rephrased as ""main goal"" for clarity.- ""non-inferiority"" is a complex term that is simplified by rephrasing the sentence to focus on the comparison between the two groups.- ""FEV1"" is a technical term that is briefly defined as ""lung function"" to make it more accessible to a general audience."
Q4	A9	35707484	Comparative Study on the effectiveness of Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol versus Tiotropium/Formoterol in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	6	The secondary outcome was the assessment of the ratio of FEV1/FVC and state of health evaluation by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).	The secondary outcome was to measure how well the lungs were working by checking the air people could breathe out, and to evaluate their overall health through a respiratory questionnaire.
Q4	A9	35707484	Comparative Study on the effectiveness of Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol versus Tiotropium/Formoterol in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	7	Results: Out of 60 participants, 58 subjects completed the study.	Out of 60 people who started the study, 58 finished it.
Q4	A9	35707484	Comparative Study on the effectiveness of Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol versus Tiotropium/Formoterol in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	8	At week 12, the mean and standard deviation value of FEV1 between groups were 1.49 ± 0.38 and 1.38 ± 0.30 (p > 0.05) and FEV1/FVC ratio were 0.67 ± 0.09 and 0.74 ± 0.08 (p < 0.01) respectively.	"Here's the simplified version:At week 12, we compared two groups' lung function. The average amount of air they could breathe out was 1.49 and 1.38 units, which was not a big difference. However, when we looked at the ratio of air breathed out to the total air in their lungs, the two groups were different - one group had a ratio of 0.67 and the other had 0.74, which was a significant difference.Note: I replaced ""FEV1"" with ""amount of air they could breathe out"", ""FVC"" with ""total air in their lungs"", and ""p > 0.05"" and ""p < 0.01"" with ""not a big difference"" and ""significant difference"" respectively, to make the sentence easier to understand."
Q4	A9	35707484	Comparative Study on the effectiveness of Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol versus Tiotropium/Formoterol in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	9	A significant difference was observed in the FEV1 and FEV1/FVC values in comparison with baseline versus last follow up in both the groups (p < 0.01).	A significant difference was found in the lung function test results when comparing the initial and final check-ups in both groups (the difference was statistically significant).
Q4	A9	35707484	Comparative Study on the effectiveness of Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol versus Tiotropium/Formoterol in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	10	However, no remarkable variation was identified in the FEV1 values over the two groups.	There was no significant difference found in the FEV1 values when comparing the two groups.(Note: I assumed FEV1 might be unfamiliar to some readers, but it's a common term in medical contexts. If needed, I can provide a definition: FEV1 stands for Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second, a measure of lung function.)
Q4	A9	35707484	Comparative Study on the effectiveness of Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol versus Tiotropium/Formoterol in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	11	The health status assessment by SGRQ showed significant improvement in both groups after the treatment.	"The health status assessment by SGRQ showed significant improvement in both groups after the treatment.Simplified:A health check using a standard method called SGRQ showed that both groups felt better after the treatment.(Note: I assumed SGRQ might be unfamiliar to a general audience, so I added a brief explanation. If the audience is expected to be familiar with SGRQ, the simplified sentence could be even shorter: ""A health check showed that both groups felt better after the treatment."")"
Q4	A9	35707484	Comparative Study on the effectiveness of Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol versus Tiotropium/Formoterol in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	12	Conclusion: Non-inferiority of GFF when compared to TFF was established along with good tolerability and comparable adverse effect profile.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Conclusion: We found that GFF is just as effective as TFF, and it's well-tolerated with similar side effects.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, and replaced the term ""non-inferiority"" with ""just as effective"" to make it easier to understand."
Q4	A10	32764912	Nebulized Therapies in COPD: Past, Present, and the Future	1	Current guidelines recommend inhalation therapy as the preferred route of drug administration for treating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).	Current guidelines suggest that breathing in medicine is the best way to treat patients with a long-term lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which makes it hard to breathe.
Q4	A10	32764912	Nebulized Therapies in COPD: Past, Present, and the Future	2	Inhalation devices consist of nebulizers and handheld inhalers, such as dry-powder inhalers (DPIs), pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), and soft mist inhalers (SMIs).	Inhalation devices include machines that turn medicine into a mist (nebulizers) and handheld devices like inhalers that use powder, spray, or a soft mist to deliver medicine.
Q4	A10	32764912	Nebulized Therapies in COPD: Past, Present, and the Future	3	Although pMDIs, DPIs and SMIs may be appropriate for most patients with COPD, certain patient populations may have challenges with these devices.	Although most people with COPD can use pMDIs, DPIs, and SMIs, some patients might have trouble using these inhalers.Note: I simplified the sentence by rephrasing it in a more straightforward way. I also assumed that pMDIs, DPIs, and SMIs refer to types of inhalers, which is a common understanding in the context of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) treatment. If needed, these terms can be further explained as:- pMDIs: pressurized metered-dose inhalers- DPIs: dry powder inhalers- SMIs: soft mist inhalers
Q4	A10	32764912	Nebulized Therapies in COPD: Past, Present, and the Future	4	Patients who have cognitive, neuromuscular, or ventilatory impairments (and receive limited assistance from caregivers), as well as those with suboptimal peak inspiratory flow may not derive the full benefit from handheld inhalers.	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Patients with brain, muscle, or breathing problems, or those who don't get much help from caregivers, might not get the full benefit from portable inhalers, especially if they have trouble breathing in deeply.
Q4	A10	32764912	Nebulized Therapies in COPD: Past, Present, and the Future	5	A considerable number of patients are not capable of producing a peak inspiratory flow rate to overcome the internal resistance of DPIs.	Some patients can't breathe in strongly enough to get the medicine from their inhalers to work properly.
Q4	A10	32764912	Nebulized Therapies in COPD: Past, Present, and the Future	6	Furthermore, patients may have difficulty coordinating inhalation with device actuation, which is required for pMDIs and SMIs.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Additionally, patients may struggle to breathe in at the same time as using their inhaler, which is necessary for some types of inhalers.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand, replacing ""coordinating inhalation with device actuation"" with ""breathe in at the same time as using their inhaler"". I also defined ""pMDIs and SMIs"" as ""some types of inhalers"" to avoid using technical terms that might be unfamiliar to non-medical readers."
Q4	A10	32764912	Nebulized Therapies in COPD: Past, Present, and the Future	7	However, inhalation devices such as spacers and valved holding chambers can be used with pMDIs to increase the efficiency of aerosol delivery.

Q5	A1	21628435	Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy	1	Aim: Trigeminal neuropathies are a group of clinical disorders that involve injury to primary first-order neurons within the trigeminal nerve.	"Aim: Trigeminal neuropathies are conditions that affect the nerves in your face, specifically the main nerves that control facial sensations.(Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it more understandable, avoiding technical terms like ""primary first-order neurons"" and explaining it in simpler terms.)"
Q5	A1	21628435	Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy	2	We review the spectrum of etiologies underlying both painful and non-painful trigeminal neuropathies, with attention to particularly dangerous processes that may elude the clinician in the absence of a meticulous evaluation.	We'll look at the different causes of painful and painless nerve problems in the face, focusing on serious conditions that might be missed if the doctor doesn't do a very thorough check.
Q5	A1	21628435	Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy	3	Complications and management issues specific to patients with trigeminal neuropathy are discussed.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:We'll talk about the problems that can happen and how to manage them in patients with nerve damage in the face.Explanation:* ""Complications"" is a general term that refers to problems or issues that can arise, so I kept it simple.* ""Management issues"" can be rephrased as ""how to manage them"" to make it clearer.* ""Trigeminal neuropathy"" is a rare term, so I replaced it with ""nerve damage in the face"", which is a more common way to describe it. The trigeminal nerve is a nerve that affects the face, so this rephrasing still conveys the same meaning."
Q5	A1	21628435	Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy	4	Methods: Retrospective literature review.	Methods: We looked back at existing research studies.
Q5	A1	21628435	Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy	5	Results: Facial or intraoral numbness, the hallmark of trigeminal neuropathy, may represent the earliest symptomology of malignancy or autoimmune connective tissue disease as sensory neurons are destroyed.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""Results: Numbness in the face or mouth can be an early warning sign of cancer or autoimmune diseases, as it means the nerves that help us feel sensations are being damaged.""I made the following changes:* Rephrased ""hallmark of trigeminal neuropathy"" to ""numbness in the face or mouth"" to make it clearer and more concise.* Replaced ""symptomology"" with ""warning sign"" to use a more common term.* Simplified ""sensory neurons are destroyed"" to ""nerves that help us feel sensations are being damaged"" to make it easier to understand."
Q5	A1	21628435	Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy	6	Such numbness, especially if progressive, necessitates periodic evaluation and vigilance even years after presentation if no diagnosis can be made.	If the numbness gets worse over time, it's crucial to keep checking and monitoring it, even years after it started, especially if we can't find a cause.
Q5	A1	21628435	Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy	7	Conclusions: In the routine evaluation of patients with facial pain, the clinician will inevitably be confronted with secondary pathology of the trigeminal nerves and nuclei.	When evaluating patients with facial pain, doctors often find other related problems affecting the nerves that control facial sensations.
Q5	A1	21628435	Numbness matters: a clinical review of trigeminal neuropathy	8	The appearance of numbness, even when pain continues to be the most pressing complaint, necessitates clinical assessment of the integrity of all aspects of the trigeminal pathways, which may also include neurophysiologic, radiographic, and laboratory evaluation.	The feeling of numbness, even if pain is still the main issue, requires a thorough medical check to ensure the nerve pathways in the face are working properly. This may involve various tests, including those that check nerve function, imaging studies, and lab work.

Q7	A5	11992348	The prominent T wave: electrocardiographic differential diagnosis	4	We also recommend that the designation hyperacute should refer exclusively to the prominent T waves of ST-segment elevation AMI.	"We also suggest that the term ""hyperacute"" should only be used to describe a specific type of heart attack with very high and peaked T waves on an ECG.(Note: I've assumed that the term ""ST-segment elevation AMI"" might be unfamiliar to non-medical readers, so I've replaced it with a more general description of a heart attack with specific ECG characteristics.)"
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	1	Hyperacute T waves (HATWs) have been described as tall-amplitude, primary T-wave abnormalities sometimes seen in the early phases of transmural myocardial infarction.	Hyperacute T waves (HATWs) are unusually tall T waves that can appear on an ECG in the early stages of a heart attack where the heart muscle is damaged.
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	2	Despite numerous human and animal studies addressing the presence and significance of HATWs, there are no widely held, reliable ECG criteria for their accurate identification.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Many studies have looked at HATWs (a type of abnormal heartbeat pattern), but there's still no clear, trustworthy way to identify them using ECG tests.Or, if you'd like to break it down further:* ""HATWs"" can be explained as ""abnormal heartbeat patterns"" or ""heart rhythm irregularities.""* ""ECG criteria"" refers to the standards or guidelines used to interpret the results of an electrocardiogram (ECG) test, which measures the heart's electrical activity.So, the simplified sentence could be:Despite many studies, there's no clear way to use ECG tests to accurately identify abnormal heartbeat patterns."
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	3	Using a specially designed computer program on a Hewlett-Packard Realm ECG analysis system, we screened 13,393 adult ECGs to identify those having T-wave amplitudes greater than accepted standards (limb leads, greater than 0.5 mV; precordial leads, greater than 1.0 mV).	We used a custom computer program on a special heart test machine to review 13,393 adult heart tests. We were looking for tests where the heartbeat signals were stronger than usual.
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	4	Patients with other known causes of primary and secondary tall T waves were excluded from the study sample.	Patients with known conditions that can cause tall T waves were not included in the study.
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	5	Patients with tall-amplitude T-waves who then developed clinically verifiable myocardial infarction were labeled the HATW group.	Patients with unusually high peaks in their heart tests who later had a confirmed heart attack were labeled the HATW group.
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	6	The HATW group (21) represented 4.1% of the tall T wave group (513) and 0.16% of the entire sample.	The HATW group made up a small part of the larger group with tall T waves (about 4%) and an even smaller part of the entire group (about 0.16%).
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	7	The remaining patients, who did not meet HATW criteria, were called the early repolarization variant (ERV) group (51).	The remaining patients who didn't meet the HATW criteria were put into a group called the early repolarization variant (ERV) group (51).
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	8	Both groups underwent comparative computer morphology analysis.	"We used computers to compare the shapes of cells or tissues in both groups.(Note: I've simplified the sentence by replacing ""computer morphology analysis"" with ""compare the shapes of cells or tissues"", which is easier to understand. The term ""morphology"" refers to the study of the shape and structure of something, in this case, cells or tissues.)"
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	9	Nine parameters were statistically significant in discriminating HATWs from early repolarization variants.	Nine factors were found to be important in telling apart a specific heart condition (HATWs) from similar but less serious heart patterns (early repolarization variants).
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	10	A combination of J-point position/T-wave amplitude of more than 25%, T-wave amplitude/QRS amplitude of more than 75%, J-point position of more than 0.30 mV, and age of more than 45 years predicted HATWs from a control group with a specificity of 98.0% and a sensitivity of 61.9% and with positive and negative predictive values of 92.9% and 86.2%, respectively.	A combination of certain heart test results and age can help identify people with a specific heart condition. To do this, we look at four things: the size and shape of the T-wave, the size of the QRS wave, the position of the J-point, and the person's age. If these results meet certain criteria, we can accurately identify the condition 98% of the time. We can also correctly rule out the condition 86.2% of the time, and if the test is positive, there's a 92.9% chance the person actually has the condition.
Q7	A6	2301787	Hyperacute T-wave criteria using computer ECG analysis	11	We conclude that HATWs have characterizable discriminating ECG morphology as determined by computer ECG analysis compared with a control group.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""We found that Heart Attacks with Troponin Waves (HATWs) have distinct patterns on heart tests that can be identified using computer analysis, when compared to a normal group.""I made the following changes:- Replaced ""characterizable discriminating ECG morphology"" with ""distinct patterns on heart tests"", which is easier to understand.- Defined ""ECG analysis"" as ""heart tests"", to make it more relatable.- Added ""(HATWs)"" to explain the acronym, making it clearer for the reader.- Changed ""control group"" to ""normal group"", to make it more accessible to a wider audience."

"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Background: Abnormal patterns on a heart test, known as inverted T waves, are often linked to heart disease and increased risk of death.I made the following changes:- ""electrocardiogram (ECG)"" was replaced with ""heart test"" to make it more accessible to non-medical readers.- ""coronary heart disease (CHD)"" was simplified to ""heart disease"" for easier understanding.- The phrase ""have been associated with"" was rephrased to ""are often linked to"" for a more straightforward explanation."
Q7	A7	32975832	The prognostic significance of T-wave inversion according to ECG lead group during long-term follow-up in the general population	2	The pathophysiology and prognostic significance of T-wave inversion may differ between different anatomical lead groups, but scientific data related to this issue is scarce.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""The way T-wave inversion affects the body and its impact on patient outcomes might vary depending on the location of the heart test leads, but there isn't much research available on this topic.""I made the following changes:* ""Pathophysiology"" is a complex term, so I replaced it with ""the way T-wave inversion affects the body"".* ""Prognostic significance"" is also a complex term, so I replaced it with ""its impact on patient outcomes"".* ""Anatomical lead groups"" is a technical term, so I simplified it to ""the location of the heart test leads"".* ""Scientific data"" is a formal term, so I replaced it with ""research"" to make it more accessible."

"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Methods: We studied a group of 6,354 Finnish people over 30 years old who had a health check, including a heart test, as part of the Health 2000 survey.I made the following changes:- Changed ""representative sample"" to ""group"" for easier understanding.- Simplified ""underwent a health examination"" to ""had a health check"".- Explained ""12-lead ECG"" as ""heart test"" since ECG is a medical term that might be unfamiliar to non-medical people."
Q7	A7	32975832	The prognostic significance of T-wave inversion according to ECG lead group during long-term follow-up in the general population	4	ECGs with T-wave inversions were divided into three anatomical lead groups (anterior, lateral, and inferior) and were compared to ECGs with no pathological T-wave inversions in multivariable-adjusted Fine-Gray and Cox regression hazard models using CHD and mortality as endpoints.	"Simplified:ECGs with abnormal T-wave patterns were grouped into three areas of the heart (front, side, and lower) and compared to normal ECGs to see if they increased the risk of heart disease and death.Explanation:- ""T-wave inversions"" is a technical term that might be unfamiliar to non-medical people, so it's simplified to ""abnormal T-wave patterns.""- ""Anatomical lead groups"" is rephrased to ""areas of the heart"" to make it clearer and more accessible.- ""Multivariable-adjusted Fine-Gray and Cox regression hazard models"" is a complex statistical term, so it's simplified to ""compared to see if they increased the risk"" to focus on the main idea.- ""Endpoints"" is simplified to ""heart disease and death"" to make it more concrete and understandable."
Q7	A7	32975832	The prognostic significance of T-wave inversion according to ECG lead group during long-term follow-up in the general population	5	Results: The follow-up for both CHD and mortality lasted approximately fifteen years (median value with interquartile ranges between 14.9 and 15.3).	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Results: We tracked the patients for about 15 years to see how coronary heart disease and death rates changed over time.I made the following changes:- ""follow-up"" was rephrased to ""tracked the patients"" for better clarity.- ""median value with interquartile ranges"" was replaced with ""about 15 years"" to simplify the language and make it more accessible.- ""CHD"" was expanded to ""coronary heart disease"" for those who may not be familiar with the abbreviation."
Q7	A7	32975832	The prognostic significance of T-wave inversion according to ECG lead group during long-term follow-up in the general population	6	In multivariate-adjusted models, anterior and lateral (but not inferior) T-wave inversions associated with increased risk of CHD (HR: 2.37 [95% confidence interval 1.20-4.68] and 1.65 [1.27-2.15], respectively).	Simplified:In our studies, we found that certain changes in the heartbeat pattern (called T-wave inversions) on the front and side of the heart were linked to a higher risk of heart disease (with a risk increase of 2.37 and 1.65 times, respectively).

Q7	A7	32975832	The prognostic significance of T-wave inversion according to ECG lead group during long-term follow-up in the general population	8	Conclusions: The prognostic information of inverted T waves differs between anatomical lead groups.	The information we get from inverted T waves on an ECG (a heart test) can vary depending on the part of the heart being looked at.
Q7	A7	32975832	The prognostic significance of T-wave inversion according to ECG lead group during long-term follow-up in the general population	9	T-wave inversion in the anterior and lateral lead groups is independently associated with the risk of CHD, and lateral T-wave inversion is also associated with increased risk of mortality.	Here's the simplified version of the sentence:Abnormalities in the heart's electrical signals, as seen in the front and side views, are linked to a higher risk of heart disease. Additionally, these abnormal signals in the side view are also associated with a greater risk of death.
Q7	A7	32975832	The prognostic significance of T-wave inversion according to ECG lead group during long-term follow-up in the general population	10	Inverted T wave in the inferior lead group proved to be a benign phenomenon.	An abnormal heart test result, called an inverted T wave in the inferior lead group, is actually harmless.
Q7	A8	32259342	Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives	1	The presence of T-wave inversion (TWI) at 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in competitive athletes is one of the major diagnostic challenges for sports physicians and consulting cardiologists.	The presence of an abnormal heart pattern, known as T-wave inversion, on a heart test can be difficult for doctors to diagnose in athletes.
Q7	A8	32259342	Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives	2	Indeed, while the presence of TWI may be associated with some benign conditions and it may be occasionally seen in healthy athletes presenting signs of cardiac remodeling, it may also represent an early sign of an underlying, concealed structural heart disease or life-threatening arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, which may be responsible for exercise-related sudden cardiac death (SCD).	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Indeed, TWI can be a sign of harmless conditions or normal heart changes in healthy athletes, but it can also be an early warning of hidden heart problems or life-threatening heart diseases that may cause sudden death during exercise.I made the following changes:* Replaced ""associated with some benign conditions"" with ""a sign of harmless conditions"" to make it more straightforward.* Changed ""presenting signs of cardiac remodeling"" to ""normal heart changes"" to simplify the concept.* Replaced ""underlying, concealed structural heart disease"" with ""hidden heart problems"" to make it more accessible.* Changed ""arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies"" to ""life-threatening heart diseases"" to convey the severity without using technical jargon.* Replaced ""exercise-related sudden cardiac death (SCD)"" with ""sudden death during exercise"" to simplify the language."
Q7	A8	32259342	Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives	3	The interpretation of TWI in athletes is complex and the inherent implications for the clinical practice represent a conundrum for physicians.	"The interpretation of TWI in athletes is complicated, and this makes it challenging for doctors to decide the best course of action in their daily practice.Note: I simplified the sentence by replacing the word ""complex"" with ""complicated"" to make it more accessible, and rephrased ""inherent implications for the clinical practice represent a conundrum"" to ""makes it challenging for doctors to decide the best course of action"" to make the language more straightforward."
Q7	A8	32259342	Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives	4	Accordingly, the detection of TWI should be viewed as a potential red flag on the ECG of young and apparently healthy athletes and warrants further investigations because it may represent the initial expression of cardiomyopathies that may not be evident until many years later and that may ultimately be associated with adverse outcomes.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""When we see TWI on an ECG of a young and seemingly healthy athlete, it's a warning sign that needs further investigation. This is because it might be an early sign of heart problems that may not be noticeable for many years and could potentially lead to serious complications.""I made the following changes:* Broke down the long sentence into two shorter ones for easier understanding* Replaced ""red flag"" with ""warning sign"" to make it more accessible to non-medical readers* Changed ""cardiomyopathies"" to ""heart problems"" to use simpler language* Defined TWI as a potential sign on an ECG, assuming it's not a commonly known term* Used more conversational language to make the sentence easier to understand."
Q7	A8	32259342	Interpretation of T-wave inversion in physiological and pathological conditions: Current state and future perspectives	5	The aim of this review is, therefore, to report an update of the literature on TWI in athletes, with a specific focus on the interpretation and management.	The goal of this review is to update the information available on TWI in athletes, focusing on how to understand and treat it.(Note: I assumed TWI stands for a specific term, possibly related to sports medicine, but without more context, I couldn't provide a more detailed explanation. If you provide more context or the full term for TWI, I can give a more accurate simplification.)
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	1	Electrocardiographic (ECG) alterations are common in hyperkalemic patients.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Changes in heart rhythm are common in patients with high potassium levels.Explanation:- ""Electrocardiographic (ECG) alterations"" is a complex term that refers to changes in the heart's rhythm as seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG). I simplified it to ""changes in heart rhythm"" for clarity.- ""Hyperkalemic"" is a rare term that refers to having high levels of potassium in the blood. I replaced it with ""high potassium levels"" for easier understanding."
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	2	While the presence of peaked T waves is the most frequent ECG alteration, reported findings on ECG sensitivity in detecting hyperkalemia are conflicting.	The most common change seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG) with high potassium levels is a peaked T wave, but studies have reported mixed results on how well ECGs can detect this condition.
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	3	Moreover, no studies have been conducted specifically in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).	Moreover, no research has focused specifically on people with sudden kidney damage.
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	4	We used the best subset selection and cross-validation methods [via linear and logistic regression and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)] to assess the ability of T waves to predict serum potassium levels or hyperkalemia (defined as serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L).	We used special statistical methods to see if the T wave part of an electrocardiogram (ECG) can help predict high potassium levels in the blood.
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	5	We included the following clinical variables as a candidate for the predictive models: peaked T waves, T wave maximum amplitude, T wave/R wave maximum amplitude ratio, age, and indicator variates for oliguria, use of ACE-inhibitors, sartans, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and loop diuretics.	We looked at several patient factors to help predict outcomes: - The shape and height of certain patterns on heart tests (called T waves)- The patient's age- Whether they had low urine output (oliguria)- The use of certain medications, including:  - ACE-inhibitors  - Sartans  - Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists  - Loop diuretics
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	6	Peaked T waves poorly predicted the serum potassium levels in both full and test sample (R2 = 0.03 and R2 = 0.01, respectively), and also poorly predicted hyperkalemia.	Simplified:The peaked T waves did not accurately show the potassium levels in the blood (R2 = 0.03 and R2 = 0.01, respectively), and also did not accurately predict high potassium levels.
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	7	The selection algorithm based on Bayesian information criterion identified T wave amplitude and use of loop diuretics as the best subset of variables predicting serum potassium.	"Here's the simplified version:Our computer program picked the most important factors that affect potassium levels in the blood. It found that the size of the T wave on an ECG and whether a patient takes a certain type of water pill (loop diuretics) are the best predictors.I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand, replacing technical terms like ""Bayesian information criterion"" and ""subset of variables"" with simpler language. I also explained what ""T wave amplitude"" and ""loop diuretics"" are in a concise way."
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	8	Nonetheless, the model accuracy was poor in both full and test sample [root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.96 mEq/L and adjR2 = 0.08 and RMSE = 0.97 mEq/L, adjR2 = 0.06, respectively].	The model didn't work very well in predicting the correct results, with an average error of about 0.96 and 0.97 units, and it only explained a small part of the variation in the data (about 8% and 6%, respectively).
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	9	T wave amplitude and the use of loop diuretics had also poor accuracy in predicting hyperkalemia in both full and test sample [area-under-curve (AUC) at receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis 0.74 and AUC 0.72, respectively].	Two things we looked at - the size of T waves on an electrocardiogram and the use of a certain type of diuretic medicine - weren't very good at predicting high potassium levels in the blood. This was true for both the main group of patients and the smaller test group.
Q7	A9	31686358	Electrocardiographic T wave alterations and prediction of hyperkalemia in patients with acute kidney injury	10	Our findings show that, in patients with AKI, electrocardiographic changes in T waves are poor predictors of serum potassium levels and of the presence of hyperkalemia.	Our study found that, in patients with kidney damage (AKI), changes in the heart's electrical signals (T waves) are not reliable indicators of high potassium levels in the blood.
Q7	A10	34239799	Transient Cardiac Dysfunction Following a Cerebrovascular Accident	1	Acute cerebral injuries are often accompanied by sudden electrocardiogram (ECG) changes such as cardiac arrhythmias, QT prolongation, and abnormal T-wave morphology.	Simplified: Severe head injuries often cause sudden changes in heart rhythms, which can be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG), such as irregular heartbeats and abnormal patterns on the heart tracing.
Q7	A10	34239799	Transient Cardiac Dysfunction Following a Cerebrovascular Accident	2	"One rare phenomenon is ""cerebral T-waves"", which are T-waves observed in the context of stroke and described as transient, symmetric, and deeply inverted."	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:One unusual occurrence is ""cerebral T-waves."" These are abnormal brain wave patterns seen in people who have had a stroke, and they are temporary, symmetrical, and very inverted.Or, in an even simpler way:""Cerebral T-waves"" is a rare brain wave pattern that can happen when someone has a stroke. It's temporary, looks the same on both sides, and is very deep."
Q7	A10	34239799	Transient Cardiac Dysfunction Following a Cerebrovascular Accident	3	The classic cerebral T wave is defined as a T-wave inversion of ≥5 mm depth in at least four contiguous precordial leads, and it is more commonly observed in the setting of acute ischemic stroke rather than hemorrhagic stroke.	"Here's the simplified text:The classic cerebral T wave is a change in the heartbeat pattern, where a certain wave on an ECG (electrocardiogram) is upside-down and at least 5 mm deep. This is seen in at least four connected areas of the heart. It's more common in people who've had a blood clot in the brain rather than bleeding in the brain.I made the following changes:- Broke down the sentence into two simpler sentences- Defined what the cerebral T wave is in simpler terms- Replaced ""T-wave inversion"" with ""a certain wave on an ECG is upside-down""- Replaced ""precorial leads"" with ""connected areas of the heart""- Replaced ""acute ischemic stroke"" with ""a blood clot in the brain""- Replaced ""hemorrhagic stroke"" with ""bleeding in the brain"""

A patient came to us with sudden fluid buildup in the lungs, abnormal heart test results, and a poorly functioning left side of the heart. This made us think they might have had a heart attack or reduced blood flow to the heart.
Q7	A10	34239799	Transient Cardiac Dysfunction Following a Cerebrovascular Accident	5	However, a brain CT scan performed on the third day of admission proved us wrong.	A brain CT scan done three days after the patient arrived at the hospital showed different results than we expected.

I've also broken down the complex sentence into simpler ones to improve clarity."
Q8	A1	27437668	FBN1: The disease-causing gene for Marfan syndrome and other genetic disorders	4	More than one thousand individual mutations in FBN1 are associated with Marfan syndrome, making genotype-phenotype correlations difficult.	"More than 1,000 different genetic changes in the FBN1 gene are linked to Marfan syndrome, making it hard to understand how the genetic changes affect the symptoms.Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:* ""individual mutations"" was simplified to ""different genetic changes"" to make the language more accessible.* ""genotype-phenotype correlations"" was simplified to ""how the genetic changes affect the symptoms"" to explain the concept in simpler terms."

"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:To understand fibrillinopathies, we need to consider how fibrillin works in different tissues and how it interacts with other structures to control important biological functions, such as how cells grow and develop.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, and I avoided using technical terms like ""microfibril microenvironments"" and ""collaborative relationship."" I also replaced ""regulation of growth factor signaling"" with a simpler phrase, ""how cells grow and develop."""
Q8	A2	23897642	Missense mutations in FBN1 exons 41 and 42 cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome with thoracic aortic disease and Marfan syndrome	1	Mutations in FBN1 cause a range of overlapping but distinct conditions including Marfan syndrome (MFS), Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), familial thoracic aortic aneurysms/dissections (FTAAD), acromicric dysplasia (AD), and geleophysic dysplasia (GD).

"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Even if the main heart arteries appear normal and have no blockages, the outer layer of the heart can still experience sudden tightening of blood vessels.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand, and I also replaced some technical terms:- ""Epicardial vasospasm"" is rephrased as ""sudden tightening of blood vessels in the outer layer of the heart""- ""Atherosclerotic plaque"" is rephrased as ""blockages""- ""Intravascular imaging"" is not explicitly mentioned in the simplified sentence, but it refers to a medical imaging technique that visualizes the inside of blood vessels."
Q9	A3	36423427	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA): A narrative review	6	While all predisposing factors are not clearly understood, cardiometabolic risk factors, and endothelium dependent and independent mechanisms that increase oxidative stress and inflammation are associated with microvascular injury, CMD and INOCA.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""While we don't fully understand what causes it, factors like heart disease and diabetes, as well as certain mechanisms that increase stress and inflammation in the body, are linked to damage in small blood vessels, a condition known as CMD, and INOCA, a type of heart disease.""Or, to make it even simpler:""We're not sure what causes all cases, but factors like heart disease, diabetes, and inflammation in the body can damage small blood vessels and lead to certain heart conditions."""
Q9	A3	36423427	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA): A narrative review	7	Cardiac autonomic dysfunction has also been implicated in abnormal vasoreactivity and persistent symptoms.	The heart's automatic nerve control can also affect how blood vessels react and lead to ongoing symptoms.
Q9	A3	36423427	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA): A narrative review	8	INOCA is under-recognized and under-diagnosed, partly due to the heterogenous patient populations and mechanisms.	INOCA is often not recognized or properly diagnosed because it can affect people in different ways and have various underlying causes.
Q9	A3	36423427	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA): A narrative review	9	However, diagnostic testing methods are available to guide INOCA management.	There are tests that can help doctors decide the best course of treatment for INOCA.
Q9	A3	36423427	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA): A narrative review	10	Treatment of INOCA is evolving, and focuses on cardiac risk factor control, improving ischemia, reducing atherosclerosis progression, and improving angina and quality of life.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Treatment for INOCA is changing, and it now focuses on controlling heart disease risks, improving blood flow, slowing down artery damage, and relieving chest pain and improving overall well-being.I made the following changes:- Broke down the sentence into simpler components- Replaced ""cardiac risk factor control"" with ""controlling heart disease risks"" for clarity- Replaced ""improving ischemia"" with ""improving blood flow"" to make it more understandable- Replaced ""reducing atherosclerosis progression"" with ""slowing down artery damage"" to make it more relatable- Replaced ""improving angina and quality of life"" with ""relieving chest pain and improving overall well-being"" to make it more accessible"
Q9	A3	36423427	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA): A narrative review	11	This review focuses on INOCA, relations to HFpEF, available diagnostics, current and investigational therapeutic strategies, and knowledge gaps in this condition.	Here's the simplified version:This review looks at a condition called INOCA, its connection to a type of heart failure, how it's diagnosed, current and experimental treatments, and what we still don't know about it.Note: I assumed INOCA and HFpEF might be unfamiliar terms for non-medical readers, but I didn't replace them as they seem to be specific medical conditions. If you'd like, I can add a brief definition for these terms, e.g.:INOCA: A condition where the heart doesn't get enough blood flow, but the arteries aren't blocked.HFpEF: A type of heart failure where the heart is stiff and can't fill properly.
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	1	Symptomatic women with angina are more likely to have ischemia with no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) compared to men.	Women who experience symptoms of chest pain are more likely to have reduced blood flow to the heart without a blocked artery, compared to men.
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	2	In both men and women, the finding of INOCA is not benign and is associated with adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, heart failure and angina hospitalizations.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Having INOCA (a condition where the heart's blood vessels don't work properly) in both men and women is not harmless and can lead to serious heart problems, including heart attacks, heart failure, and chest pain that requires hospitalization.I made the following changes:- Rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand- Defined INOCA in simple terms to help readers who may not be familiar with the term- Replaced technical terms like ""adverse cardiovascular events"" and ""myocardial infarction"" with more common expressions like ""serious heart problems"" and ""heart attacks"""
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	3	Women with INOCA have more angina and a lower quality of life compared to men, but they are often falsely reassured because of a lack of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and a perception of low risk.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Women with INOCA (a heart condition where the arteries don't get enough blood) often experience more chest pain and a lower quality of life than men. However, they might be told they're at low risk because their arteries don't appear blocked, which can be misleading.Or, in an even simpler form:Women with a certain heart condition often have more chest pain and a lower quality of life than men, but they may be incorrectly told they're not at risk because their arteries seem fine.
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	4	Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is a key pathophysiologic contributor to INOCA, and non-invasive imaging methods are used to detect impaired microvascular flow.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is a major cause of INOCA. To diagnose this, doctors use non-invasive imaging tests to see if there's a problem with blood flow in the small vessels of the heart.""Or, if you'd like me to define the terms instead of replacing them:""Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), a condition where the small vessels of the heart don't work properly, is a key contributor to INOCA. To detect this, doctors use non-invasive imaging methods to see if there's a problem with blood flow in these small vessels.""Let me know if you'd like me to simplify it further!"
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	5	Coronary vasospasm is another mechanism of INOCA, and can co-exist with CMD, but usually requires invasive coronary function testing (CFT) with provocation testing for a definitive diagnosis.	"Coronary vasospasm is another cause of INOCA, which can happen alongside CMD. To confirm this, a special test called coronary function testing (CFT) is usually needed, which involves provoking the condition to check for it.(Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and clearer, and avoided using rare terms or jargon. However, I've kept the term ""coronary function testing"" as it's a specific medical term, but it's not extremely rare or complex. If you'd like, I can try to simplify it further or provide a brief definition.)"
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	6	In addition to traditional heart disease risk factors, inflammatory, hormonal and psychological risk factors that impact microvascular tone are implicated in INOCA.	In addition to the usual things that increase the risk of heart disease, other factors such as inflammation, hormonal changes, and mental health issues can also affect the small blood vessels and contribute to INOCA.
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	7	Treatment of risk factors and use of anti-atherosclerotic and anti-anginal medications offer benefit.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Simplified: Treating health risks and using medicines to prevent artery blockage and chest pain can be helpful.I made the following changes:- ""Treatment of risk factors"" was rephrased as ""Treating health risks"" for clarity.- ""Anti-atherosclerotic"" was replaced with ""prevent artery blockage"", as it's a simpler way to explain the term. Atherosclerosis is a condition where arteries become narrowed or blocked due to plaque buildup.- ""Anti-anginal"" was replaced with ""chest pain"", as it's a more common term for describing angina, which is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart."
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	8	Increasing awareness and early referral to specialized centers that focus on INOCA management can improve patient-oriented outcomes.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Raising awareness and sending patients to specialized centers early can lead to better results for the patient.I made the following changes:- Rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and clear.- Replaced ""INOCA management"" with a more general term, as it's a specialized term that might be unfamiliar to non-medical professionals. If needed, INOCA can be defined as ""Invasive Non-Obstructive Coronary Artery disease,"" but in this context, it's not necessary to include the full term."
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	9	However, large, randomized treatment trials to investigate the impact on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are needed.	To study the effect on serious heart problems, we need to do large, controlled tests with many patients.
Q9	A4	38224068	Ischemia but no obstructive coronary artery disease: more than meets the eye	10	In this focused review, we discuss the prevalence, pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis and treatment of INOCA.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""In this review, we'll talk about how common INOCA is, what causes it, its symptoms, how it's diagnosed, and how it's treated.""I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, replacing ""focused review"" with ""review"" and breaking down the technical terms into simpler concepts. I also assumed that INOCA is a medical condition, but if it's an abbreviation, it would be helpful to define it for clarity."
Q9	A5	34902504	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries in patients with stable ischemic heart disease	1	A large proportion of patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is found to have ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA).	"Many patients suspected to have a blockage in their heart's blood vessels are actually found to have a different condition where their heart doesn't get enough blood, but without a blockage.Note: I simplified the term ""obstructive coronary artery disease"" to ""blockage in their heart's blood vessels"" and ""ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)"" to ""a condition where their heart doesn't get enough blood, but without a blockage""."
Q9	A5	34902504	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries in patients with stable ischemic heart disease	2	Based on current evidence, these patients are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, even though they have no obstructive CAD.	These patients are more likely to have heart problems, even if they don't have blocked coronary arteries.
Q9	A5	34902504	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries in patients with stable ischemic heart disease	3	Importantly, INOCA is associated with recurrent clinical presentations with chest pain, impaired functional capacity, reduced health-related quality of life, and high healthcare costs.	INOCA is a condition that often leads to repeated episodes of chest pain, limits daily activities, affects overall well-being, and results in high medical expenses.
Q9	A5	34902504	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries in patients with stable ischemic heart disease	4	Underlying coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), through endothelium-dependent and independent mechanisms contribute to these adverse outcomes in INOCA.	"Here's the simplified version of the sentence:""Problems with the small blood vessels in the heart, which can be caused by different factors, contribute to these poor outcomes in INOCA.""Note: I've assumed that INOCA is a medical term that the patient may be familiar with, as it is not explicitly defined in the original sentence. If necessary, a definition for INOCA can be added, such as ""INOCA, a condition where the heart doesn't get enough blood flow, despite having no blockages in the main arteries."""
Q9	A5	34902504	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries in patients with stable ischemic heart disease	5	While non-invasive and invasive diagnostic testing has typically focused on identification of obstructive CAD in symptomatic patients, functional testing to detect coronary epicardial and microvascular dysfunction should be considered in those with INOCA who have persistent angina.	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Original: While non-invasive and invasive diagnostic testing has typically focused on identification of obstructive CAD in symptomatic patients, functional testing to detect coronary epicardial and microvascular dysfunction should be considered in those with INOCA who have persistent angina.Simplified: Usually, doctors use tests to find blockages in heart arteries in patients with symptoms. However, for patients with a condition called INOCA and ongoing chest pain, we should also consider using special tests to check how well the heart's blood vessels are working.Explanation of rare terms:- CAD: Coronary Artery Disease (a condition where heart arteries get blocked)- INOCA: Ischemia with No Obstructive Coronary Artery (a condition where the heart doesn't get enough blood, but the arteries aren't blocked)- Epicardial and microvascular dysfunction: problems with the heart's blood vessels that can cause chest pain.
Q9	A5	34902504	Ischemia and no obstructive coronary arteries in patients with stable ischemic heart disease	6	Current diagnostic methods to clarify functional abnormalities and treatment strategies for epicardial and/or microvascular dysfunction in INOCA are reviewed.	"Here's the simplified version of the sentence:Current methods for diagnosing and treating problems with blood flow to the heart, specifically in cases of INOCA, are reviewed.Note: I've replaced ""functional abnormalities"" with ""problems with blood flow to the heart"", ""epicardial and/or microvascular dysfunction"" with ""problems with blood flow to the heart"", and ""INOCA"" is left as is, assuming it's an abbreviation that will be explained elsewhere in the text. If not, it could be expanded to its full form, which is likely ""Invasive Non-Obstructive Coronary Artery disease""."
Q9	A6	38222977	Clinical aspects of ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)	1	Ischemia with no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) is defined as patients with evidence of myocardial ischemia without obstructive coronary artery disease.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""Ischemia with no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) refers to patients who show signs of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, but don't have any blockages in the main heart arteries.""I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, and also defined the term ""myocardial ischemia"" in simpler terms as ""reduced blood flow to the heart muscle""."
Q9	A6	38222977	Clinical aspects of ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)	2	About 3-4 million people in the United States have INOCA, more commonly affecting women, and carries adverse morbidity, mortality, and relatively high healthcare costs.	Here's the simplified text:Approximately 3-4 million people in the United States have INOCA, which is more common in women and can lead to serious health issues, death, and high medical expenses.Note: I didn't replace INOCA as it seems like an acronym for a medical condition, but if you want me to define it, I can. INOCA stands for Ischemia with No Obstructive Coronary Artery disease.
Q9	A6	38222977	Clinical aspects of ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)	3	The pathophysiology of INOCA appears to be multi-factorial with a variety of contributing mechanisms.	"The pathophysiology of INOCA is complex and likely caused by several different factors.(Note: I didn't replace ""pathophysiology"" as it's a term commonly used in medical contexts, but if needed, it can be defined as ""the study of the changes that occur in the body due to disease"".)Alternatively, a more simplified version could be:INOCA is a complex condition that is likely caused by a combination of different factors.If you'd like to define pathophysiology, here's another version:The study of the changes that occur in the body due to INOCA is complex and likely caused by several different factors."
Q9	A6	38222977	Clinical aspects of ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)	4	Diagnosis of INOCA is suggested by non-invasive or invasive testing consistent with myocardial ischemia.	INOCA (a condition where the heart doesn't get enough blood) is diagnosed when tests show the heart muscle isn't getting enough blood, even if the coronary arteries are not blocked.
Q9	A6	38222977	Clinical aspects of ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)	5	Due to the high prevalence of coronary risk factors and atherosclerosis in the INOCA population, current treatment strategies target angina, coronary atherosclerosis, and atherosclerotic risk factors, as well as burgeoning treatment of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD).	People with INOCA often have factors that increase their risk of heart disease and narrowed arteries. To address this, current treatments focus on managing chest pain, artery narrowing, and risk factors. They also aim to treat problems with the small blood vessels in the heart.
Q9	A6	38222977	Clinical aspects of ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)	6	Ongoing clinical trials are assessing different options.	Current medical studies are looking at various choices.

Q9	A8	28239488	Effect of angina under-recognition on treatment in outpatients with stable ischaemic heart disease	3	Methods and results: Patients with CAD from 25 US cardiology outpatient practices completed the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) prior to their clinic visit, and angina was categorized as daily, weekly, monthly and no angina.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Patients with heart disease from 25 US cardiology clinics answered a questionnaire about their chest pain before visiting the doctor. Their chest pain was then grouped into four categories: daily, weekly, monthly, or none.I made the following changes:* ""Methods and results"" was removed as it's not essential to the main message.* ""CAD"" (Coronary Artery Disease) was replaced with ""heart disease"" to make it more accessible.* ""Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)"" was shortened to ""questionnaire about their chest pain"" to simplify the language.* ""categorized"" was replaced with ""grouped"" to use a more common term.* ""angina"" was replaced with ""chest pain"" to make it more relatable."
Q9	A8	28239488	Effect of angina under-recognition on treatment in outpatients with stable ischaemic heart disease	4	Cardiologists (n=155) independently quantified patients' angina, blinded to patients' SAQ scores.	Cardiologists (155 of them) rated each patient's chest pain without knowing how the patients had rated it themselves.
Q9	A8	28239488	Effect of angina under-recognition on treatment in outpatients with stable ischaemic heart disease	5	Under-recognition was defined as the physician reporting a lower category of angina frequency than the patient.	"Here's the simplified version of the sentence:Under-recognition happens when a doctor thinks a patient's chest pain is less frequent than what the patient actually experiences.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, replacing ""lower category of angina frequency"" with ""less frequent"" to simplify the language."
Q9	A8	28239488	Effect of angina under-recognition on treatment in outpatients with stable ischaemic heart disease	6	Among 1257 patients with CAD, 411 reported angina in the past month, of whom 178 (43.3%) patients were under-recognized.

Q9	A8	28239488	Effect of angina under-recognition on treatment in outpatients with stable ischaemic heart disease	7	Treatment escalation-defined as intensification (up-titration or addition) of antianginal medications, referral for diagnostic testing or revascularization, or hospital admission-occurred in 106 (25.8%) patients with angina.	Treatment was increased in 106 (25.8%) patients with chest pain. This increase could be adding stronger medications, having more tests, or needing hospital care to improve blood flow to the heart.
Q9	A8	28239488	Effect of angina under-recognition on treatment in outpatients with stable ischaemic heart disease	8	Patients with under-recognized angina were less likely to get treatment escalation than patients whose angina was appropriately recognized (8.4% vs 39.1%, P<0.001).	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence: Patients who didn't get a proper diagnosis for their chest pain were less likely to receive increased treatment compared to those who got a correct diagnosis (8.4% vs 39.1%, which is a significant difference).Note: I've replaced ""under-recognized angina"" with ""didn't get a proper diagnosis for their chest pain"" to make it more understandable. I've also added a brief explanation of the statistical term ""P<0.001"" to indicate that the difference is significant."
Q9	A8	28239488	Effect of angina under-recognition on treatment in outpatients with stable ischaemic heart disease	9	In a hierarchical multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as the burden of angina, under-recognition remained strongly associated with a lack of treatment escalation (adjusted OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.04-0.21, P<0.001).	"Here's the simplified text:After considering various factors such as age, health conditions, and the severity of chest pain, we found that under-recognition of a condition is strongly linked to not increasing treatment (with a very low chance of 0.10, and a 95% confidence interval of 0.04-0.21, which is statistically significant).Note: I've replaced the technical term ""hierarchical multivariable logistic regression model"" with a simpler phrase ""considering various factors"", and also explained the statistical terms in simpler language."
Q9	A8	28239488	Effect of angina under-recognition on treatment in outpatients with stable ischaemic heart disease	10	Conclusions: Under-recognition of angina in cardiology outpatient practices is associated with less aggressive treatment escalation and may lead to poorer angina control.	Conclusions: Many doctors in cardiology clinics don't recognize angina symptoms, which can lead to less effective treatment and poorer management of angina.
Q9	A8	28239488	Effect of angina under-recognition on treatment in outpatients with stable ischaemic heart disease	11	Standardizing clinical recognition of angina using validated tools could reduce under-recognition of angina, facilitate treatment, and potentially improve outcomes.	Using standard methods to identify angina in patients can help doctors recognize it more accurately, treat it better, and possibly improve patient results.

The usefulness of a certain test (AP) in predicting the future health of patients with diabetes (DM) and heart disease (CAD) is not well understood.(Note: I've replaced the abbreviations with full terms to make the sentence more accessible to a general audience. If you'd like me to define the terms instead, here's an alternative:The usefulness of Amylin Precursor (AP) in predicting the future health of patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is not well understood.)However, if you want me to explain it in even simpler terms:We don't know how well a certain test can help us predict what will happen to patients who have both diabetes and heart disease.
Q9	A9	28395884	Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus and With Versus Without Angina Pectoris (from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease)	4	We analyzed patients with CAD who underwent coronary angiography at Duke University from 2002 to 2011 and compared patients with and without AP within the previous 6 weeks stratified by DM status.	"We looked at patients with heart disease who had a special heart test at Duke University from 2002 to 2011. We then compared two groups of patients: those who had a heart attack in the last 6 weeks and those who didn't, and we also considered whether or not they had diabetes.Note: I replaced CAD with ""heart disease"", AP with ""heart attack"", and DM with ""diabetes"" to make the terms more accessible."
Q9	A9	28395884	Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus and With Versus Without Angina Pectoris (from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease)	5	We used multivariable Cox regression to assess the association between AP and the outcomes of cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization/revascularization, all-cause mortality/myocardial infarction/revascularization, and all-cause mortality.	We used a statistical method to study the connection between AP and several health outcomes, including heart-related hospitalizations, death from any cause, heart attacks, and procedures to improve blood flow.
Q9	A9	28395884	Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus and With Versus Without Angina Pectoris (from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease)	6	Of 17,211 patients with CAD, 5,284 (31%) had DM and AP was present in 69% of DM and 67% of non-DM.	"Out of 17,211 patients with heart disease, 5,284 (31%) also had diabetes. A condition called AP was found in 69% of those with diabetes and 67% of those without diabetes.(Note: I assumed CAD stands for Coronary Artery Disease, DM stands for Diabetes Mellitus, and AP is another medical condition. If you want me to simplify these terms as well, I can replace them with more common terms, such as ""heart disease"" for CAD and ""diabetes"" for DM.)"
Q9	A9	28395884	Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus and With Versus Without Angina Pectoris (from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease)	7	After risk adjustment, the risk of CV hospitalization/revascularization and all-cause mortality/myocardial infarction/revascularization in patients with and without AP was similar regardless of DM status (all p ≥0.05).	"Here's the simplified version:After adjusting for other health risks, patients with and without AP had similar chances of heart-related hospital stays, heart attacks, or death, regardless of whether they had diabetes or not.I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand, avoiding technical terms like ""CV hospitalization/revascularization"" and ""all-cause mortality/myocardial infarction/revascularization"". I also replaced ""DM status"" with ""whether they had diabetes or not"" to make it clearer."
Q9	A9	28395884	Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus and With Versus Without Angina Pectoris (from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease)	8	In patients with or without DM, AP was associated with lower all-cause mortality compared with no AP (adjusted hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.97, p = 0.005 for DM patients).	In patients with or without diabetes, having atrial pacing (AP) was linked to a lower risk of death from any cause, compared to those without AP.
Q9	A9	28395884	Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus and With Versus Without Angina Pectoris (from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease)	9	The relation between AP status and clinical outcomes was not dependent on DM status (all interaction p >0.10).	The connection between AP status and patient results was not affected by whether or not the patient had diabetes.
Q9	A9	28395884	Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus and With Versus Without Angina Pectoris (from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease)	10	In conclusion, in patients with CAD, AP was associated with similar risk for CV hospitalization and revascularization and lower all-cause mortality compared with patients without AP regardless of DM status.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:In conclusion, for patients with coronary artery disease, having atrial fibrillation (AP) doesn't increase the risk of hospitalization for heart problems or needing further heart procedures, and may even lower the overall risk of death, whether or not they have diabetes (DM).
Q9	A9	28395884	Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus and With Versus Without Angina Pectoris (from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease)	11	Future studies are needed to assess whether these findings are related to increased severity of disease in those without AP or whether AP leads to differential management that improves survival.	More research is needed to determine if these results are due to a more severe illness in people without AP, or if having AP leads to different treatment decisions that improve chances of survival.
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	1	Background: Patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, coronary artery disease (CAD), and angina are often thought to have a worse prognosis and a greater prognostic benefit from coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery than those without angina.	"Here's the simplified version:People with heart problems, such as weak heart muscles, blocked arteries, and chest pain, are often expected to have a poorer outlook. However, they may benefit more from a type of heart surgery called coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) compared to those without chest pain.I made the following changes:- Replaced technical terms with simpler explanations (e.g., ""left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction"" became ""weak heart muscles"")- Broke down complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones- Removed technical jargon (e.g., ""prognostic benefit"") and replaced it with more accessible language (e.g., ""benefit more from"")"
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	2	Objectives: This study investigated: 1) whether angina was associated with a worse prognosis; 2) whether angina identified patients who had a greater survival benefit from CABG; and 3) whether CABG improved angina in patients with LV systolic dysfunction and CAD.	Here's the simplified text:Objectives: This study looked at three things: 1) If having angina made a patient's outlook worse.2) If patients with angina benefited more from a specific heart surgery (CABG).3) If this surgery (CABG) helped relieve angina in patients with heart problems (LV systolic dysfunction and CAD).Note: I've defined the rare terms in simpler words, - CABG is a specific heart surgery (it stands for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting)- LV systolic dysfunction refers to heart problems (specifically issues with the left ventricle's pumping function)- CAD stands for Coronary Artery Disease
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	3	Methods: We performed an analysis of the STICH (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial, in which 1,212 patients with an ejection fraction ≤35% and CAD were randomized to CABG or medical therapy.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Methods: We studied a group of 1,212 patients with weak hearts and narrowed arteries. They were randomly assigned to either have heart surgery or receive medication.Note: I replaced the following terms for clarity:- ""analysis"" with ""studied""- ""ejection fraction ≤35%"" with ""weak hearts"" (as ejection fraction is a measure of heart function, and a low value indicates a weak heart)- ""CAD"" with ""narrowed arteries"" (as CAD stands for Coronary Artery Disease, which is characterized by narrowed arteries)- ""CABG"" with ""heart surgery"" (as CABG stands for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, which is a type of heart surgery)"
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	4	Multivariable Cox and logistic models were used to assess long-term clinical outcomes.	"We used advanced statistical methods to evaluate the long-term results of treatments and their effects on patients.Note: I replaced the technical terms ""Multivariable Cox and logistic models"" with a simpler phrase ""advanced statistical methods"" to make it more understandable for a general audience."
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	5	Results: At baseline, 770 patients (64%) reported angina.	Results: At the start of the study, 770 patients (64%) had chest pain.
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	6	Among patients assigned to medical therapy, all-cause mortality was similar in patients with and without angina (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79 to 1.38).	"Among patients who received medical treatment, the overall death rate was about the same for those who had chest pain (angina) and those who didn't.Note: I simplified the sentence by removing technical terms such as ""hazard ratio"" and ""confidence interval"", and rephrased it in simpler terms to make it easier to understand."
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	7	The effect of CABG was similar whether the patient had angina (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.13) or not (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.94; p interaction = 0.14).	"The effect of heart bypass surgery (CABG) was about the same for patients with chest pain (angina) and those without it.Note: I've simplified the sentence by removing technical terms like ""HR"" (Hazard Ratio) and ""95% CI"" (95% Confidence Interval), and rephrased the sentence to focus on the main message. I've also omitted the p-value and interaction term, as they are technical details that may not be essential for a general understanding of the sentence."
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	8	Patients assigned to CABG were more likely to report improvement in angina than those assigned to medical therapy alone (odds ratio: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.90; p < 0.01).	Patients who had CABG surgery were more likely to feel better from chest pain than those who only received medicine.
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	9	Conclusions: Angina does not predict all-cause mortality in medically treated patients with LV systolic dysfunction and CAD, nor does it identify patients who have a greater survival benefit from CABG.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Conclusions: Having chest pain (angina) doesn't necessarily mean medically treated patients with heart problems will have a higher risk of death. Also, it doesn't help identify which patients will benefit more from a specific type of heart surgery (CABG).
Q9	A10	26541919	Importance of angina in patients with coronary disease, heart failure, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from STICH	10	However, CABG does improve angina to a greater extent than medical therapy alone.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Having a heart bypass surgery (CABG) can reduce chest pain more effectively than just taking medicine.Explanation:- ""CABG"" is a medical term that might be unfamiliar to non-medical people, so I replaced it with ""heart bypass surgery"" to make it clearer.- ""Angina"" is a medical term that refers to chest pain, so I replaced it with ""chest pain"" to make it more relatable.- The sentence structure remains the same, but I used simpler vocabulary to make it easier to understand."

Q10	A8	11750250	Tamsulosin: current clinical experience	2	Population-based studies confirm that lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are very common among aging men.	Many older men experience problems with urinating.
Q10	A8	11750250	Tamsulosin: current clinical experience	3	These studies have confirmed that men with moderate-to-severe symptoms have 4 to 6 times more trouble and interference with activities of daily living and twice the level of worry as those with mild symptoms.	Men with severe symptoms have 4-6 times more problems with daily activities and twice the level of worry compared to those with mild symptoms.
Q10	A8	11750250	Tamsulosin: current clinical experience	4	The realization by patients and their physicians that most men >50 years of age will develop LUTS, has resulted in increased awareness of pharmacologic agents, principally alpha-adrenergic antagonists, as a first line of therapy for this condition.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Many men over 50 years old will experience Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS). As a result, patients and their doctors are now more aware of the available medications, mainly a type of medicine called alpha-blockers, which are often the first treatment choice for this condition.Note: I replaced ""pharmacologic agents"" with ""medications"" and ""alpha-adrenergic antagonists"" with ""alpha-blockers"" to make the sentence more understandable."
Q10	A8	11750250	Tamsulosin: current clinical experience	5	Alpha blockers were introduced >30 years ago to treat LUTS and today are the mainstay in pharmacologic therapy.

Q11	A5	35270022	Chromosome Segregation in the Oocyte: What Goes Wrong during Aging	5	Notably, the increased rate of sub- and infertility, aneuploidy, miscarriages, and birth defects are associated with advanced maternal age, especially in women above 35 years of age.	Women over 35 are more likely to have trouble getting pregnant, and they're also at a higher risk for having babies with birth defects or genetic problems.
Q11	A5	35270022	Chromosome Segregation in the Oocyte: What Goes Wrong during Aging	6	This postponement is also relevant for human evolution; decades ago, the female aging-related fertility drop was not as important as it is today because women were having their children at a younger age.	This delay is also important for understanding human history; in the past, women's ability to have children didn't decline as quickly with age because they were having children at a younger age.Or This delay is also significant in human evolution; years ago, women's age-related decline in fertility wasn't as significant as it is now because they were having children earlier in life.
Q11	A5	35270022	Chromosome Segregation in the Oocyte: What Goes Wrong during Aging	7	Spindle assembly is crucial for chromosome segregation during each cell division and oocyte maturation, making it an important event for euploidy.	Spindle assembly is vital for cells to divide correctly and for egg cells to mature properly, ensuring that each new cell has the right number of chromosomes.
Q11	A5	35270022	Chromosome Segregation in the Oocyte: What Goes Wrong during Aging	8	Consequently, aberrations in this segregation process, especially during the first meiotic division in human eggs, can lead to implantation failure or spontaneous abortion.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:When this process doesn't happen correctly, especially in the early stages of egg development, it can cause problems with pregnancy, such as miscarriage or trouble getting pregnant.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand, replacing complex terms like ""aberrations in this segregation process"" with simpler language.

Q11	A5	35270022	Chromosome Segregation in the Oocyte: What Goes Wrong during Aging	10	However, the shift in the reproductive phase of humans and the strong increase in errors make the problem much more dramatic at later stages of the female reproductive phase.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:However, the changes in women's reproductive cycles and the rise in errors make the problem more severe as women get older.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand, replacing the phrase ""reproductive phase of humans"" with ""women's reproductive cycles"" and ""later stages of the female reproductive phase"" with ""as women get older""."
Q11	A5	35270022	Chromosome Segregation in the Oocyte: What Goes Wrong during Aging	11	Aneuploidy in human eggs could be the result of the non-disjunction of entire chromosomes or sister chromatids during oocyte meiosis, but partial or segmental aneuploidies are also relevant.	Aneuploidy in human eggs happens when there's an error in how the chromosomes divide during egg cell development. This can result in having either too many or too few chromosomes, and sometimes it affects only a part of the chromosome.
Q11	A5	35270022	Chromosome Segregation in the Oocyte: What Goes Wrong during Aging	12	In this review, we intend to describe the relevance of the spindle apparatus during oocyte maturation for proper chromosome segregation in the context of maternal aging and the female reproductive lifespan.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:In this review, we'll discuss how a tiny part of the cell, called the spindle apparatus, helps the egg cell (oocyte) mature properly, especially in older women, so that it can divide correctly.Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:- ""Spindle apparatus"" is a rare term, so I added a brief explanation of what it is.- ""Oocyte maturation"" is a complex term, so I replaced it with ""egg cell mature properly"".- ""Chromosome segregation"" is a technical term, so I replaced it with ""divide correctly"".- ""Maternal aging"" is a technical term, so I replaced it with ""older women"".- The sentence structure was also simplified to make it easier to understand."

Q11	A7	4096700	Mechanisms of nondisjunction: facts and perspectives	1	An ordered segregation requires distinct processes of differentiation within the germ cell for recognition and segregation of homologous chromosomes/chromatids.	For the cells to separate properly, the reproductive cell must go through different steps to identify and separate matching chromosomes.
Q11	A7	4096700	Mechanisms of nondisjunction: facts and perspectives	2	These include synchronous maturation of the nucleus and cytoplasm, chromosome pairing and assembly at the metaphase plate, and movement within the spindle; all of them may be under direct/indirect regulatory control by the surrounding somatic compartments.

If the embryo doesn't develop, the centromere still has an advantage.Here's a breakdown of the changes made:1. ""Reproductive compensation"" is a complex term, but it's not necessary to understand the main idea. I removed it to simplify the sentence.2. ""Selection can favour a centromere"" is a bit formal. I rephrased it to ""This process helps the centromere"" to make it more accessible.3. ""Induces lethal aneuploidy"" is a technical term. I replaced it with ""causes a problem that prevents the embryo from developing properly"" to make it clearer.4. ""If, when taken towards the polar body, it instead kills the embryo via aneuploidy"" is a long and complex sentence. I broke it down into simpler language: ""If the embryo doesn't develop"".5. ""It gains"" is a bit vague. I rephrased it to ""the centromere still has an advantage"" to make it clearer."
Q11	A9	35788750	Selfish centromeres and the wastefulness of human reproduction	6	The model is consistent with the observation that reduced dosage of a murine drive suppressor induces aneuploidy and with the fact that high aneuploidy rates in vertebrates are seen exclusively in mammals.	The model matches the finding that lower doses of a specific gene regulator in mice can cause abnormal cell division and the fact that high rates of abnormal cell division in animals with backbones are only seen in mammals.(Note: I replaced'murine drive suppressor' with'specific gene regulator in mice' for simplicity and defined 'aneuploidy' as 'abnormal cell division' to make the text more accessible to a general audience.)
Q11	A9	35788750	Selfish centromeres and the wastefulness of human reproduction	7	I propose further tests of this idea.	I think we should do some more tests to see if this idea is correct.
Q11	A9	35788750	Selfish centromeres and the wastefulness of human reproduction	8	The wastefulness of human reproduction may be a price we pay for nurturing our offspring.	The simplified version of the sentence is:Having children can be inefficient, but it's a trade-off for being able to care for them.
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	1	The most commonly accepted view about the origin of aneuploidy is that it is due to errors in meiotic division.	"The most widely accepted explanation for aneuploidy is that it's caused by mistakes that happen when cells divide during reproduction.(Note: I replaced ""meiotic division"" with ""reproduction"" to make it simpler, and also rephrased the sentence to make it more straightforward and easy to understand.)"
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	2	However, its rare occurrence makes it difficult to explain recurrent births of trisomic children to some parents.	"It's challenging to explain to some parents why they had multiple children with a rare genetic condition.(Note: I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, avoiding technical terms like ""trisomic"" which might be unfamiliar to non-medical readers. I also used simpler vocabulary to facilitate understanding.)"
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	3	This problem causes more serious concern when one accepts that an abnormal (n + 1 or n - 1) sperm would enter fertilization by overriding thousands, or even millions, of normal haploid sperms.	"Here's the simplified version of the sentence:""This problem is more concerning because it means that an abnormal sperm can sometimes be the one that fertilizes an egg, even though there are many normal sperm present.""I made the following changes:* Simplified the sentence structure for easier understanding* Replaced the technical term ""haploid"" with ""normal"" to make it more accessible* Removed the specific numbers (n + 1 or n - 1) as they may not be essential for understanding the main idea* Changed the phrase ""overriding thousands, or even millions"" to ""sometimes be the one that fertilizes"" to make it more concise and clear."
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	4	Also, the failure of aneuploidy to be induced in the offspring of mammals treated with mutagens raises questions about the effectiveness of the accepted mode of origin of errors.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Also, the fact that some chemicals that cause genetic mutations don't seem to cause birth defects in mammals makes us wonder if our current understanding of how these errors occur is correct.I replaced the following terms or phrases to make the sentence clearer:- ""Aneuploidy"" with ""genetic mutations"" (aneuploidy refers to a condition where a cell has an abnormal number of chromosomes)- ""Induced in the offspring"" with ""cause birth defects"" (to make the language more accessible)- ""Mutagens"" with ""some chemicals that cause genetic mutations"" (mutagens are substances that can cause genetic mutations)- ""Accepted mode of origin of errors"" with ""current understanding of how these errors occur"" (to make the language more concise and clear)"
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	5	Current concepts also do not explain why one observes more errors of meiotic I, than of meiotic II, origin.	Current ideas can't explain why there are more mistakes in the first part of cell division (meiotic I) than in the second part (meiotic II).Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and easier to understand, and also defined the terms'meiotic I' and'meiotic II' in a concise manner, although they weren't explicitly flagged as rare terms.
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	6	It is known that most chromosomes separating at meta-anaphase junction in mitosis follow a nonrandom, genetically controlled sequence of separation.	"When cells divide, most chromosomes separate in a specific order during a stage called mitosis, and this order is controlled by our genes.Explanation:- The original sentence uses complex terms like ""meta-anaphase junction"" and ""nonrandom, genetically controlled sequence of separation"". - I simplified the sentence by replacing these terms with easier-to-understand phrases, such as ""specific order"" and ""controlled by our genes""."
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	7	The present proposal makes use of out-of-phase separation of a rare chromosome, like premature separation in mitosis of the X in elderly humans or of an 18 in parents of trisomy 18 children.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:The current proposal uses a special way of separating a rare chromosome that doesn't happen at the right time, similar to what happens in older people with the X chromosome or in parents of children with a condition called trisomy 18.Note: I replaced ""out-of-phase separation"" with ""special way of separating"" to make it easier to understand, and added a brief explanation of trisomy 18 to provide context."
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	8	The suggestion is made that such out-of-phase separation results in aneuploid cell lines by total failure of the centromere to separate or by it separating too early, before the spindle is formed.	The idea is that when cell separation doesn't happen at the right time, it can lead to abnormal cells. This might occur if a crucial part of the cell, called the centromere, doesn't split properly or splits too soon, before the cell is fully prepared to divide.
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	9	The prematurely separating centromeres, it appears, do not attach to spindle fibers and hence cause nondisjunction.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:The centromeres that separate too early don't connect to the fibers that help chromosomes move, which leads to a problem where chromosomes don't separate correctly.In simpler terms:- ""Prematurely separating centromeres"" refers to parts of chromosomes that split too early.- ""Spindle fibers"" are like tiny threads that help chromosomes move during cell division.- ""Nondisjunction"" is a term that describes a problem where chromosomes don't separate correctly during cell division.Let me know if you'd like me to simplify anything else."
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	10	Such nondisjunction in embryonic stages will produce apparently normal individuals with mosaicism in somatic and/or gametic tissue.	When cells divide incorrectly during early development, it can result in individuals who appear normal but have a mixture of normal and abnormal cells in their body tissues, including the cells that produce eggs or sperm.
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	11	An individual carrying mosaicism in gonadal tissue will produce a large number of abnormal gametes, one of which may have a reasonable chance of entering fertilization.	A person with a certain genetic condition in their reproductive cells will likely produce many abnormal cells that can be used for reproduction. One of these abnormal cells might have a good chance of being used to make a baby.
Q11	A10	6232200	Sequence of centromere separation another mechanism for the origin of nondisjunction	12	This mode of origin of aneuploidy takes care of all questions raised above and finds support in the data available in the literature.	"This explanation for how aneuploidy starts answers all our previous questions and is also supported by information found in medical studies.Note: I replaced ""mode of origin"" with ""explanation for how it starts"" to simplify the sentence, and ""literature"" with ""medical studies"" to make it more accessible to non-experts."

Q18	A4	36971598	The Risk of Infertility After Surgery for Benign Ovarian Cysts	10	Infertility after surgery was more common for women reporting cyst surgery than those without surgery after adjusting for age, race, body mass index, cancer history, parity before assigned surgery age, history of infertility before surgery age, and endometriosis (median-adjusted hazard ratio 2.41, 95% simulation interval 1.03-6.78).	Simplified:Women who had surgery to remove cysts were more likely to have trouble getting pregnant compared to those who didn't have surgery. This was true even when we considered other factors like age, race, weight, history of cancer, number of past pregnancies, past fertility issues, and endometriosis (a condition where tissue grows outside the uterus).
Q18	A4	36971598	The Risk of Infertility After Surgery for Benign Ovarian Cysts	11	The estimated geometric mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) AMH levels of those who reported a history of ovarian cyst surgery were 1.08 (95% CI: 0.57-2.05) times those of women who reported no history of surgery.	"Here's the simplified version of the sentence:Women who had surgery for ovarian cysts had AMH levels about 1.08 times those of women who didn't have this surgery.I made the following changes:* Removed the technical term ""geometric mean"" and the abbreviation ""CI"" (confidence interval) as they might be unfamiliar to non-medical readers.* Simplified the phrase ""reported a history of ovarian cyst surgery"" to ""had surgery for ovarian cysts"" to make it more concise and easier to understand.* Changed the phrase ""times those of women who reported no history of surgery"" to ""those of women who didn't have this surgery"" to make it more straightforward."
Q18	A4	36971598	The Risk of Infertility After Surgery for Benign Ovarian Cysts	12	Conclusions: Those with a history of ovarian cyst surgery were more likely to report having a history of infertility compared with age-matched women who reported no history of cyst surgery.	Women who had surgery for ovarian cysts were more likely to have trouble getting pregnant compared to women of the same age who didn't have this surgery.
Q18	A4	36971598	The Risk of Infertility After Surgery for Benign Ovarian Cysts	13	It is possible that both ovarian surgery to remove cysts and the conditions that lead women to develop cysts requiring surgery may affect subsequent successful conception.	Having surgery to remove cysts from the ovaries and the conditions that cause these cysts might both affect a woman's ability to get pregnant later on.

The size of the ovarian cyst did not appear to increase the risk of fluid leakage (the chances of leakage were about the same, with a range of slightly less to slightly more).
Q18	A5	33279627	Short- and Long-Term Complications of Intraoperative Benign Ovarian Cyst Spillage: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	7	Intraoperative benign ovarian cyst rupture was not associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes such as reoperation (RR 1.16; 95% CI, 0.39-3.48), infertility (RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.15-3.63), transient fever (RR 3.22; 95% CI, 0.83-12.51), and readmission (RR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.33-2.98).	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Rupturing a harmless ovarian cyst during surgery didn't seem to cause serious problems in the short or long term, such as needing another operation, infertility, temporary fever, or returning to the hospital.I replaced technical terms and phrases with simpler alternatives:- ""Intraoperative"" became ""during surgery""- ""Benign ovarian cyst rupture"" became ""rupturing a harmless ovarian cyst""- ""Adverse short- and long-term outcomes"" became ""serious problems in the short or long term""- ""Reoperation"" became ""needing another operation""- ""Transient fever"" became ""temporary fever""- ""Readmission"" became ""returning to the hospital""- Removed the relative risk (RR) and confidence interval (CI) values as they might be confusing for non-medical readers."
Q18	A5	33279627	Short- and Long-Term Complications of Intraoperative Benign Ovarian Cyst Spillage: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	8	However, intraoperative spillage was found to be associated with increased risk for benign recurrence (RR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.05-9.14).	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:However, when some of the tumor spilled out during surgery, it was found to increase the risk of the non-cancerous tumor coming back (about 3 times more likely).Explanation:- ""Intraoperative spillage"" was rephrased as ""when some of the tumor spilled out during surgery"" for clarity.- ""Benign recurrence"" was rephrased as ""non-cancerous tumor coming back"" to avoid using technical terms.- ""RR"" and ""95% CI"" were omitted as they are statistical terms that might be unfamiliar to non-experts, but the main idea of increased risk was preserved."
Q18	A5	33279627	Short- and Long-Term Complications of Intraoperative Benign Ovarian Cyst Spillage: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	9	A subgroup analysis of the studies that included only dermoid cysts showed an association between intraoperative cyst rupture and postoperative chemical peritonitis (RR 9.36; 95% CI, 1.20-73.28).	A subgroup analysis of the studies that included only dermoid cysts showed an association between intraoperative cyst rupture and postoperative chemical peritonitis (RR 9.36; 95% CI, 1.20-73.28).Simplified: Looking at a smaller group of studies that only included a certain type of cyst (dermoid cyst), we found a link between the cyst breaking open during surgery and a type of infection (chemical peritonitis) after surgery.
Q18	A5	33279627	Short- and Long-Term Complications of Intraoperative Benign Ovarian Cyst Spillage: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	10	Conclusion: Intraoperative ovarian cyst spillage of a benign cyst is associated with limited adverse clinical outcomes.	When a non-cancerous ovarian cyst breaks open during surgery, it usually doesn't cause serious problems.
Q18	A5	33279627	Short- and Long-Term Complications of Intraoperative Benign Ovarian Cyst Spillage: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	11	Although the surgical approach (minimally invasive vs open) should not be affected by the concern regarding an intraoperative cyst rupture, maximal efforts should be made to prevent intra-abdominal spillage.	The type of surgery (small incision or open) shouldn't be influenced by the risk of a cyst bursting during the operation. However, surgeons should try their best to prevent the cyst's contents from spilling into the abdominal area.
Q18	A6	36120464	Effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cyst	1	Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cysts.

Q18	A6	36120464	Effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cyst	3	All patients underwent laparoscopic cystectomy.	All patients had a minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove a cyst.
Q18	A6	36120464	Effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cyst	4	Serum levels of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) were measured pre-and, 3 months postoperatively.	"We checked the level of a hormone called antimüllerian hormone (AMH) in the blood before and 3 months after surgery.Note: I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise. I also chose not to replace or define ""antimüllerian hormone (AMH)"" as it is a specific medical term that may be unfamiliar to non-medical readers, but is likely to be understood by medical professionals or patients familiar with the context."
Q18	A6	36120464	Effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cyst	5	The primary outcome of the study was to assess the effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve based on alterations in serum AMH levels.	The main goal of the study was to see how a type of surgery called laparoscopic cystectomy affects a woman's remaining eggs, by measuring the level of a hormone called AMH in her blood.(Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and more understandable, and also defined what AMH is, in case the patient is not familiar with the term. AMH stands for Anti-Müllerian Hormone, but I didn't include the full definition to keep the explanation concise.)
Q18	A6	36120464	Effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cyst	6	The secondary outcome of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the number of cauterizations, size and type of cysts, bilaterality (bilateral or unilateral), age, and body mass index (BMI) on the ovarian reserve after laparoscopic excision.	The secondary goal of this study was to see how certain factors - such as the number of treatments, cyst size and type, whether the cysts were on one or both sides, age, and body mass index (BMI, a measure of body fat) - affect the ovaries after a minimally invasive surgical procedure.
Q18	A6	36120464	Effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cyst	7	Results: Laparoscopic cystectomy reduced the serum AMH levels preoperatively (1.32 ± 4.48 ng/ml) to postoperatively (3.2 ± 1.93 ng/ml) and the difference (- 1.28 ng/ml) was statistically different (0.001 >P).	"Simplified:Results: We found that removing ovarian cysts using a minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic cystectomy) lowered the AMH levels in the blood. Before the surgery, the AMH level was 1.32 ng/ml, and after the surgery, it was 3.2 ng/ml. The change was significant.Note: I replaced ""serum AMH levels"" with ""AMH levels in the blood"" to make it more understandable. I also removed the ± symbol and the numbers after it, as they represent the standard deviation, which might be confusing for non-medical readers. Instead, I focused on the main finding that the AMH levels decreased after the surgery."
Q18	A6	36120464	Effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cyst	8	There was a negative significant relationship between the number of cauterizations used and postoperative serum AMH levels (p ≤ 0.001).	Simplified:We found that the more times a surgical tool was used to stop bleeding, the lower the level of a certain hormone (AMH) in the blood after surgery.
Q18	A6	36120464	Effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cyst	9	There was a significant relationship between the location (p ≤ 0.01), type of cyst (p ≤ 0.001) and the serum AMH levels reduction.	The study found a strong connection between where the cyst was located, the type of cyst, and the decrease in AMH levels in the blood.
Q18	A6	36120464	Effect of laparoscopic cystectomy on ovarian reserve in patients with ovarian cyst	10	Conclusion: The number of cauterizations used during surgery, the type of cyst, and bilaterality can affect AMH levels that need to be addressed.	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Conclusion: The number of cauterizations during surgery, the type of cyst, and whether the cyst is on one or both sides can impact AMH levels and should be considered.Note: I assumed that AMH is a known term in this context, but if it's not, here's a possible definition: AMH stands for Anti-Müllerian Hormone, a hormone that indicates the health of a woman's ovaries. If you want to include this definition, here's the revised sentence:Conclusion: The number of cauterizations during surgery, the type of cyst, and whether the cyst is on one or both sides can impact Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels - a hormone that shows the health of a woman's ovaries - and should be considered.
Q18	A7	24559614	Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when?	1	The relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility is a subject of debate, mainly because it is difficult to determine the real impact of the cyst and its treatment on later fertility.

Q18	A7	24559614	Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when?	5	Our study is based on a review of the literature dealing with the epidemiology of ovarian cysts and the effects of their surgical management in relation to infertility.	Our study looks at past research on how common ovarian cysts are and how surgery to remove them affects a woman's ability to get pregnant.
Q18	A7	24559614	Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when?	6	Analysis of the epidemiologic data, drawn mainly from comparative studies and cohorts, shows that the role of cysts in infertility is controversial and that the effects of surgical treatment are often more harmful than the cyst itself to the ovarian reserve.	"Simplified:Looking at the research data, mostly from comparison studies, we see that the link between cysts and infertility is unclear. Also, surgery to treat cysts can sometimes harm the ovaries more than the cyst itself.(Note: I've rephrased complex sentences and replaced technical terms with simpler language. For example, ""epidemiologic data"" is referred to as ""research data"", ""cohorts"" is not mentioned as it's not crucial to the main message, ""ovarian reserve"" is referred to as ""the ovaries"" for simplicity.)"

Q18	A7	24559614	Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when?	8	When a surgical option is nonetheless chosen, a conservative laparoscopic approach is more suitable.	If surgery is still chosen, a less invasive laparoscopic method is often preferred.
Q18	A7	24559614	Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when?	9	Besides excision, sclerotherapy and plasma vaporization are promising, offering a greater preservation of the ovarian parenchyma, especially in endometriomas.	Besides removing the affected area, there are other promising treatments like sclerotherapy (a procedure to close off blood vessels) and plasma vaporization (using a special gas to remove tissue). These methods can better preserve the healthy part of the ovary, especially when treating endometriomas (a type of cyst).
Q18	A7	24559614	Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when?	10	These techniques must be better defined.	These methods need to be more clearly explained.
Q18	A7	24559614	Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when?	11	The context of the infertility is essential, and surgeons and specialists in reproductive medicine should decide management jointly.	The reason for infertility is important, so fertility doctors and surgeons should work together to decide on the best treatment plan.

It affects about 1 in 5 people, mostly women, and greatly impacts their daily life and medical expenses.
Q19	A2	34463082	Recent advances in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	3	Four different entities of IBS have been identified: IBS with constipation (IBS‑ C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS D), IBS with a mixed pattern of constipation and diarrhea, and unclassified IBS.	There are four main types of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): 1. IBS with constipation (when you have trouble going to the bathroom and your stool is hard).2. IBS with diarrhea (when you go to the bathroom too often and your stool is loose).3. IBS with a mix of constipation and diarrhea (when you experience both of the above symptoms).4. Unclassified IBS (when your symptoms don't fit into the other categories).
Q19	A2	34463082	Recent advances in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	4	Although the precise pathogenesis of IBS remains unclear, its multifactorial nature is evident and includes environmental and host factors.	The exact cause of IBS is still not fully understood, but it's clear that many factors, including things in the environment and the person's own body, play a role in developing the condition.
Q19	A2	34463082	Recent advances in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	5	Management of patients with this disease is challenging and a personalized approach is required.	Taking care of patients with this disease can be difficult, so we need to tailor our approach to each person's individual needs.
Q19	A2	34463082	Recent advances in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	6	A strong, reassuring physician‑ patient relationship is crucial, followed by patient education, dietary advice, and stress reduction.	A good doctor-patient relationship is very important, and it should be followed by teaching the patient about their condition, giving advice on healthy eating, and helping them manage stress.
Q19	A2	34463082	Recent advances in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	7	For nonresponding patients, the therapeutic approach may include nonpharmacological therapies and / or pharmacotherapy.	For patients who don't respond to treatment, the doctor may try non-medication therapies, medication, or a combination of both.
Q19	A2	34463082	Recent advances in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	8	The choice of pharmacological treatment is based on the predominant symptom and a prespecified time point should be planned for effectiveness evaluation and dose adjustment.	"The choice of medication depends on the main symptom, and we should plan a specific time to check if it's working and if the dose needs to be changed.I simplified the sentence by:- Replacing ""pharmacological treatment"" with ""medication"" for easier understanding.- Breaking down the sentence into simpler parts for clarity.- Using more common terms like ""main symptom"" instead of ""predominant symptom"".- Rephrasing ""effectiveness evaluation and dose adjustment"" to ""check if it's working and if the dose needs to be changed"" for a more straightforward explanation."
Q19	A2	34463082	Recent advances in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	9	In patients with IBS‑ D, the therapeutic options include mainly antibiotics, such as rifaximin, peripheral opioid agonists, mixed opioid agonists / antagonists, bile acid sequestrants, and antagonists of serotonin 5‑ hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptors.	Here's the simplified version of the given sentence:In patients with IBS-D (a type of irritable bowel syndrome), treatment options include antibiotics like rifaximin, medications that affect opioid receptors, and other medicines that help with digestion and serotonin regulation.Note: I've explained IBS-D in simple terms for better understanding, as it might not be familiar to everyone.

Q19	A2	34463082	Recent advances in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	12	The involvement of gastrointestinal microbiota constitutes a fascinating field of exploration as it offers the potential to be modulated by the use of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics as well as fecal microbiota transplantation.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:The study of gut bacteria is an interesting area of research because it can be influenced by using helpful bacteria, special foods for these bacteria, and even transferring healthy bacteria from one person to another.I made the following changes:- Replaced ""gastrointestinal microbiota"" with ""gut bacteria"" to use a more common term.- Changed ""constitutes a fascinating field of exploration"" to ""is an interesting area of research"" for clarity.- Simplified ""offers the potential to be modulated"" to ""can be influenced"" to make the sentence easier to understand.- Replaced ""probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics"" with ""helpful bacteria, special foods for these bacteria"" to define these terms in simpler language.- Explained ""fecal microbiota transplantation"" as ""transferring healthy bacteria from one person to another"" to make it more understandable."
Q19	A2	34463082	Recent advances in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	13	This review offers an updated overview on the recent advances in the treatment of IBS.	This review provides the latest information on new ways to treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	1	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) encountered in clinical practice.	"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common condition that affects the stomach and intestines, and doctors often see it in their patients.Note: I've replaced ""functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs)"" with ""affects the stomach and intestines"" to make it more understandable for a general audience, and also rephrased the sentence to make it simpler."
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	2	In the absence of an accurate biomarker for the disorder, IBS is mainly diagnosed based symptomology using the Rome criteria.	Since there's no perfect test for IBS, doctors usually diagnose it by looking at the symptoms and using the Rome criteria.
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	3	Due to the heterogeneity of the disorder, finding the correct treatment option is often challenging.	Because this condition can be very different from person to person, it's often hard to find the right treatment.
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	4	In general, lifestyle and dietary changes, including the low-FODMAP of gluten-free diet, are the first-in-line treatment for all patients.	In general, changing your lifestyle and diet, such as eating a gluten-free diet low in FODMAPs, is the first step in treating all patients.(Note: FODMAPs is a term that might be unfamiliar to some, so it could be helpful to define it. Here's an example of how you could simplify it further:In general, changing your lifestyle and diet, such as eating a gluten-free diet low in certain types of carbohydrates that can be hard to digest, is the first step in treating all patients.)Or, if you want to keep the term FODMAPs, you could add a brief definition in parentheses:In general, changing your lifestyle and diet, such as eating a gluten-free diet low in FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides, and Polyols, which are types of carbohydrates that can be hard to digest), is the first step in treating all patients.
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	5	Issues with dietary changes are the strict elimination of multiple food products and hence difficult compliance to the diet.	Dietary changes can be challenging because they often require completely cutting out many foods, making it hard for people to stick to the diet.
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	6	When lifestyle changes do not lead to adequate symptom relief, patients should be treated according to their predominant bowel habits and most prominent symptoms.	"If lifestyle changes don't help ease symptoms, patients should be treated based on their main bowel habits and most bothersome symptoms.(Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, avoiding complex phrases like ""adequate symptom relief"" and ""predominant bowel habits and most prominent symptoms"".)"
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	7	Laxatives or prokinetics and antidiarrheals are used to treat constipation and diarrhea respectively, but have little effect on abdominal pain.	Medicines like laxatives or prokinetics can help with constipation, while antidiarrheals help with diarrhea, but they don't do much to relieve stomach pain.
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	8	To treat gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms, antispasmodics can be attributed.	"To treat stomach and intestinal symptoms, antispasmodics can be used.(Note: I replaced ""attributed"" with ""used"" for clarity, as ""attributed"" is not the most common verb in this context. Also, I used a more common term ""stomach and intestinal symptoms"" instead of ""gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms"" to make it easier to understand.)"
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	9	Low doses of neuromodulators can help gain control over GI and central symptoms, but are also prone to more severe side effects, restricting their widespread use.	Small amounts of certain medicines can help manage symptoms in the stomach and brain, but these medicines can also cause serious side effects, limiting their use.
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	10	Refractory IBS symptoms can be treated with probiotics, antibiotics, histamine-receptor antagonists or alternative therapy, including psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, acupuncture or phytomedicines.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Hard-to-treat IBS symptoms can be treated with special bacteria (probiotics), medicines that fight infection (antibiotics), or other alternative treatments like therapy sessions, hypnosis, acupuncture, or herbal medicines.Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:* ""Refractory"" is a rare term that means ""hard-to-treat"" or ""resistant to treatment"". I replaced it with simpler language.* I defined ""probiotics"" as ""special bacteria"" to make it more understandable.* I used simpler terms like ""medicines that fight infection"" instead of ""antibiotics"", although ""antibiotics"" is a common term, it's still a bit technical.* I replaced ""histamine-receptor antagonists"" with ""other alternative treatments"" as it's a technical term that might be hard to understand for non-medical people.* I defined ""phytomedicines"" as ""herbal medicines"" to make it more understandable."
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	11	However, for many of these options, scientific evidence is sparse and high-quality research is often lacking, leading to inconclusive results.	There isn't enough reliable research to support many of these options, which means the results are often unclear.
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	12	In general, all of the available treatment options only provide symptom relief for a subset of patients.	Most available treatments only help some patients feel better, by relieving their symptoms.
Q19	A3	31820883	Irritable bowel syndrome: diagnosis and management	13	This review provides a full overview of the diagnostic process and currently available treatment options for IBS.	This review explains how doctors diagnose and treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), covering all the available methods.
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	1	Importance: The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the United States is between 7% and 16%, most common in women and young people, with annual direct costs estimated at more than $1 billion dollars in the United States.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects around 7-16% of people in the US, mostly women and younger individuals, resulting in over $1 billion in annual medical costs.I made the following changes:- Rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and easier to understand.- Removed the word ""prevalence"" and replaced it with ""affects"" to make the sentence more straightforward.- Kept the term ""irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)"" as it's a relatively well-known medical condition, but if needed, it could be explained as ""a condition causing stomach pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements."""
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	2	Traditionally, the diagnosis of IBS has been based on the positive identification of symptoms that correlate with several different syndromes associated with disorders such as IBS diarrhea, IBS constipation, functional diarrhea, functional constipation, chronic functional abdominal pain, or bloating.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Traditionally, doctors diagnose IBS by identifying symptoms that match certain patterns, such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or bloating.I made the following changes:- Rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and easier to understand.- Removed technical terms like ""syndromes"" and ""disorders"" to make the sentence more accessible.- Replaced ""positive identification of symptoms"" with ""identifying symptoms"" to simplify the language.- Removed the phrase ""associated with disorders"" as it's not essential to the main idea of the sentence.- Used simpler terms like ""abdominal pain"" instead of ""chronic functional abdominal pain"" to make the sentence more understandable."
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	3	Several peripheral and central mechanisms initiate gastrointestinal motor and sensory dysfunctions leading to IBS symptoms.	"Here's the simplified version of the given sentence:Both local and overall body processes can cause problems with digestion and bowel movements, resulting in symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).I replaced ""peripheral and central mechanisms"" with ""local and overall body processes"" to make it easier to understand. I also defined what IBS symptoms are to provide context for the reader."
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	4	Those dysfunctions may require evaluation in patients whose symptoms do not respond to first-line treatments.	Those problems might need further testing in patients whose symptoms don't improve with initial treatments.
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	5	Observations: Validation studies of consensus symptom-based criteria have identified deficiencies that favor a simpler identification of the predominant symptoms of abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction, and bloating and exclusion of alarm symptoms such as unintentional weight loss, rectal bleeding, or recent change in bowel function.	"Observations: Studies have shown that the current way of identifying symptoms of abdominal pain, bowel problems, and bloating is not perfect. A simpler approach would focus on the main symptoms and rule out warning signs like unexplained weight loss, bleeding from the rectum, or recent bowel changes.Explanation:- I rephrased the sentence to make it more straightforward and easier to understand.- I replaced ""consensus symptom-based criteria"" with ""the current way of identifying symptoms"" to simplify the language.- I defined ""alarm symptoms"" as ""warning signs"" to make the term more accessible.- I used simpler vocabulary, such as ""bowel problems"" instead of ""bowel dysfunction"", to improve clarity."
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	6	Symptom-based diagnosis of IBS is enhanced with additional history for symptoms of somatoform and psychological disorders and alarm symptoms, physical examination including digital rectal examination, and screening tests to exclude organic disease (by measuring hemoglobin and C-reactive protein concentrations).	"Here's a simplified version of the text:To diagnose IBS based on symptoms, we also look at the patient's history for signs of mental health issues or other serious conditions. We do a physical exam, including a rectal exam, and run some tests to rule out other diseases. These tests check for things like anemia (by measuring hemoglobin) and inflammation (by measuring C-reactive protein).Note: I've replaced ""somatoform and psychological disorders"" with ""mental health issues"" to make it more accessible, and also rephrased the sentence structure for clarity."
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	7	The initial treatment plan should include patient education, reassurance, and first-line treatments such as fiber and osmotic laxatives for constipation, opioids for diarrhea, antispasmodics for pain and for management of associated psychological disorders.	"The initial treatment plan should include teaching the patient about their condition, reassuring them, and using basic treatments like fiber and laxatives for constipation, certain medications for diarrhea, and medications to help with pain and related mental health issues.Note: I replaced ""first-line treatments"" with ""basic treatments"" for simplicity and ""osmotic laxatives"" was left as is, but could be further explained as ""medications that help soften stool"" if needed. ""Antispasmodics"" was also left as is, but could be further explained as ""medications that help relax muscles"" if needed."
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	8	For patients who do not respond to those IBS treatments, testing for specific functional disorders may be required in a minority of patients with IBS.	If some patients don't get better with the usual treatments for IBS, they might need additional tests to check for other underlying conditions, although this is only necessary for a small number of patients with IBS.
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	9	These disorders include rectal evacuation disorder, abnormal colonic transit, and bile acid diarrhea.	"These disorders include problems with bowel movements, slow or irregular movement of food through the intestines, and diarrhea caused by bile acid issues.(Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and easier to understand. I've also replaced technical terms with more common language, such as ""bowel movements"" instead of ""rectal evacuation disorder"" and ""diarrhea caused by bile acid issues"" instead of ""bile acid diarrhea"".)"
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	10	Their identification is followed by individualized treatment, such as pelvic floor retraining for rectal evacuation disorders, sequestrants for bile acid diarrhea, and secretory agents for constipation, although there is only limited evidence that this individualized management approach is effective.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Once we identify the specific problem, we can provide personalized treatment, such as physical therapy to help with bowel movements, medication to stop diarrhea, or other medications to treat constipation. However, there's not a lot of proof that this customized approach actually works.
Q19	A4	33651094	Diagnosis and Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Review	11	"Conclusions and relevance: Advances in the identification of specific dysfunctions as causes of individual symptoms in the ""IBS spectrum"" leads to the potential to enhance the diagnosis and management of symptoms for the majority of patients for whom first-line therapies of IBS and management of comorbid psychological disorders are insufficient."	"Here's a simplified version of the provided sentence:New discoveries about the underlying causes of individual symptoms in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) can improve diagnosis and treatment for most patients who don't respond well to initial treatments or have related mental health issues.I made the following changes:- Rephrased complex sentences for clarity- Replaced ""IBS spectrum"" with ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)"" for better understanding- Replaced ""comorbid psychological disorders"" with ""related mental health issues"" for a more common term- Replaced ""first-line therapies"" with ""initial treatments"" for a simpler term"

Q19	A5	34249316	Best management of irritable bowel syndrome	4	It should be emphasised that symptoms are often chronic, and that treatment, while aiming to improve symptoms, may not relieve them completely.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:It's essential to note that symptoms can be long-lasting, and while treatment can help improve them, it might not eliminate them entirely.I made the following changes:- Changed ""emphasised"" to ""essential to note"" for clarity.- Replaced ""chronic"" with ""long-lasting"" to use a more common term.- Simplified the sentence structure for easier understanding."
Q19	A5	34249316	Best management of irritable bowel syndrome	5	Initial management should include simple lifestyle and dietary advice, discussion of the possible benefit of some probiotics, and, if this is unsuccessful, patients can be referred to a dietician for consideration of a low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Initial management should start with basic lifestyle and diet advice. We may also discuss how certain probiotics can help. If this doesn't work, we can refer you to a dietician who can suggest a special diet that's easier to digest.Note: I've avoided using the term ""FODMAP"" directly, as it's a complex term. Instead, I've focused on explaining the concept in simpler terms, i.e., ""a special diet that's easier to digest""."
Q19	A5	34249316	Best management of irritable bowel syndrome	6	Antispasmodics and peppermint oil can be used first-line for the treatment of abdominal pain.	Antispasmodics and peppermint oil are often the first choice to help relieve stomach pain.
Q19	A5	34249316	Best management of irritable bowel syndrome	7	If patients fail to respond, central neuromodulators can be used second-line; tricyclic antidepressants should be preferred.	"If patients don't respond to treatment, we can try other medications that affect the brain; we usually prefer a type of antidepressant called tricyclics.(Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and easier to understand, while also replacing the term ""central neuromodulators"" with a more general phrase ""medications that affect the brain"" to make it more accessible to a wider audience.)"
Q19	A5	34249316	Best management of irritable bowel syndrome	8	Loperamide and laxatives can be used first-line for treating diarrhoea and constipation, respectively.	"Loperamide and laxatives are often the first choice to treat diarrhea and constipation, respectively.(I replaced ""first-line"" with ""often the first choice"" to make it easier to understand, and ""diarrhoea"" with ""diarrhea"" to use a more common spelling in American English.)"
Q19	A5	34249316	Best management of irritable bowel syndrome	9	Patients with constipation who fail to respond to laxatives should be offered a trial of linaclotide.	"If a patient has constipation and laxatives don't work, they should try linaclotide.(Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and easier to understand. The term ""linaclotide"" is a specific medication, so I've left it as is, but if needed, it can be defined as ""a type of medicine that helps with bowel movements"".)"
Q19	A5	34249316	Best management of irritable bowel syndrome	10	For patients with diarrhoea, the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor agonists alosetron and ramosetron appear to be the most effective second-line drugs.	For patients with diarrhea, two medicines called alosetron and ramosetron seem to work best as a second option.
Q19	A5	34249316	Best management of irritable bowel syndrome	11	Where these are unavailable, ondansetron is a reasonable alternative.	If the first options aren't available, ondansetron can be used instead.

Q19	A6	34927757	Review Article: Current and future treatment approaches for IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) and IBS mixed pattern (IBS-M)	1	Background: Irritable bowel syndrome-diarrhoea (IBS-D) and IBS-mixed stool pattern (IBS-M) are disorders of gut-brain interaction characterised by abdominal pain associated with diarrhoea or both diarrhoea and constipation respectively.	Here's the simplified version of the given sentence:Background: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) comes in two forms: one with diarrhea (IBS-D) and the other with both diarrhea and constipation (IBS-M). Both are conditions where the stomach and brain don't work well together, causing stomach pain along with changes in bowel movements.
Q19	A6	34927757	Review Article: Current and future treatment approaches for IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) and IBS mixed pattern (IBS-M)	2	The pathophysiology of IBS-D/M is multifactorial and not completely understood; thus, treatment is aimed at multiple mechanisms such as altering gut microbiota, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal permeability, gut-brain interaction and psychological strategies.	"The causes of IBS-D/M are complex and not fully known, so treatment focuses on multiple areas, including changing the balance of gut bacteria, reducing sensitivity in the digestive system, improving how the gut and brain interact, and using psychological approaches to manage symptoms.Explanation:- ""Pathophysiology"" is a complex term that refers to the study of the changes that occur within the body due to disease. I replaced it with ""causes"" for simplicity.- ""Multifactorial"" means having many factors or causes. I rephrased it to ""complex"" for easier understanding.- ""Visceral hypersensitivity"" refers to increased sensitivity in the digestive system. I rephrased it to ""reducing sensitivity in the digestive system"" for clarity.- ""Intestinal permeability"" refers to how easily substances can pass through the gut lining. I didn't mention it explicitly, as it's a bit complex, but it's implied in ""improving how the gut and brain interact"".- ""Gut-brain interaction"" is a term that refers to the communication between the gut and the brain. I left it as is, but rephrased the surrounding sentence to make it clearer.- ""Psychological strategies"" refers to using mental or emotional approaches to manage symptoms. I rephrased it to ""psychological approaches to manage symptoms"" for clarity."

Q20	A2	28336049	Hypothyroidism	1	Hypothyroidism is a common condition of thyroid hormone deficiency, which is readily diagnosed and managed but potentially fatal in severe cases if untreated.	Hypothyroidism is a condition where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones. It's usually easy to diagnose and treat, but if left untreated, severe cases can be life-threatening.
Q20	A2	28336049	Hypothyroidism	2	The definition of hypothyroidism is based on statistical reference ranges of the relevant biochemical parameters and is increasingly a matter of debate.	The definition of hypothyroidism (a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones) is based on standard laboratory test results, but doctors are still discussing what exactly qualifies as hypothyroidism.
Q20	A2	28336049	Hypothyroidism	3	Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism range from life threatening to no signs or symptoms.	The symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary greatly, from being very severe and life-threatening to having no noticeable signs at all.
Q20	A2	28336049	Hypothyroidism	4	The most common symptoms in adults are fatigue, lethargy, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, change in voice, and dry skin, but clinical presentation can differ with age and sex, among other factors.	The most common symptoms in adults are feeling extremely tired, lacking energy, feeling cold, gaining weight, having bowel movements less often, a change in voice, and dry skin, but these symptoms can vary depending on a person's age and sex.
Q20	A2	28336049	Hypothyroidism	5	The standard treatment is thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine.	The usual treatment is taking medicine that replaces the hormones the thyroid gland can't produce, and the most commonly used medicine is called levothyroxine.
Q20	A2	28336049	Hypothyroidism	6	However, a substantial proportion of patients who reach biochemical treatment targets have persistent complaints.	Many patients who meet their treatment goals still have ongoing symptoms and concerns.
Q20	A2	28336049	Hypothyroidism	7	In this Seminar, we discuss the epidemiology, causes, and symptoms of hypothyroidism; summarise evidence on diagnosis, long-term risk, treatment, and management; and highlight future directions for research.	In this Seminar, we will talk about what causes low thyroid hormone levels, its symptoms, and how it's diagnosed and treated. We will also look at potential long-term risks and discuss what research needs to be done in the future.
Q20	A3	29631518	Over- and Under-Treatment of Hypothyroidism Is Associated with Excess Mortality: A Register-Based Cohort Study	1	Objective: This study investigated the association between hypothyroidism and mortality in both treated and untreated hypothyroid patients, and the consequences of over- and under-treatment with respect to mortality.	This study looked at how hypothyroidism (a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones) affects a person's chances of survival, whether they're receiving treatment or not, and how getting too much or too little treatment impacts survival.
Q20	A3	29631518	Over- and Under-Treatment of Hypothyroidism Is Associated with Excess Mortality: A Register-Based Cohort Study	2	Patients and methods: This was a register-based cohort study of 235,168 individuals who had at least one serum thyrotropin (TSH) during 1995-2011 (median follow-up 7.2 years).	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""This study looked at 235,168 people who had their thyroid function checked at least once between 1995 and 2011, and we followed them for an average of 7.2 years.""I made the following changes:* Changed ""register-based cohort study"" to ""study"" to make it more accessible.* Explained what ""serum thyrotropin (TSH)"" is by rephrasing it as ""thyroid function checked"".* Simplified the phrase ""median follow-up"" to ""we followed them for an average of""."
Q20	A3	29631518	Over- and Under-Treatment of Hypothyroidism Is Associated with Excess Mortality: A Register-Based Cohort Study	3	Hypothyroidism was defined as at least two measurements of TSH >4.0 mIU/L within a half year spaced by at least 14 days, or one measurement of TSH >4.0 mIU/L and two filled prescriptions of levothyroxine the following year.	"Hypothyroidism was diagnosed if a patient had two high thyroid hormone level tests (TSH > 4.0 mIU/L) at least 14 days apart within six months, or one high test and took thyroid medication (levothyroxine) at least twice in the following year.Note: I replaced ""at least two measurements"" with ""two high thyroid hormone level tests"" to make it easier to understand, and also replaced ""filled prescriptions"" with ""took thyroid medication"" for clarity."
Q20	A3	29631518	Over- and Under-Treatment of Hypothyroidism Is Associated with Excess Mortality: A Register-Based Cohort Study	4	All-cause mortality rates were calculated using multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities using the Charlson Comorbidity Index.	To calculate the overall death rate from all causes, we used a statistical method that considered age, sex, and other existing health conditions.
Q20	A3	29631518	Over- and Under-Treatment of Hypothyroidism Is Associated with Excess Mortality: A Register-Based Cohort Study	5	Results: Mortality was increased in untreated hypothyroid individuals (n = 673; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.46 [confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.69]; p < 0.001) compared to euthyroid controls.	"Here's the simplified version of the sentence:Results: We found that people with untreated low thyroid hormone levels (673 individuals) were more likely to die than those with normal thyroid hormone levels.Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:* ""Mortality was increased"" is rephrased to ""were more likely to die"" to make the language more accessible.* ""Untreated hypothyroid individuals"" is simplified to ""people with untreated low thyroid hormone levels"" to avoid using the rare term ""hypothyroid"".* ""Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.46 [confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.69]; p < 0.001"" is omitted as it's a statistical detail that's not essential for understanding the main result. If you want to keep this information, you could rephrase it to something like ""This difference was statistically significant, meaning it's unlikely to be due to chance."""

"Here's the simplified version of the sentence:""This study shows that eating foods that don't raise blood sugar quickly and taking a medicine called metformin can help improve conditions related to metabolic syndrome.""I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, replacing technical terms with simpler language. Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:* ""Conclusions"" is implied, so I removed it to make the sentence more direct.* ""Low glycemic index diet"" is a technical term, so I rephrased it to ""eating foods that don't raise blood sugar quickly"", which is easier to understand.* ""Metformin"" is a specific medication, so I kept it as is, but added a brief description (""a medicine"") to provide context.* ""Metabolic syndrome components"" is a technical term, so I rephrased it to ""conditions related to metabolic syndrome"", which is more general and easier to understand."
Q23	A1	25932218	Systemic side effects of locally used oxymetazoline	1	Considering the chemical properties of topical decongestants, they’re investigated in two groups: Sympathomimetic agents (phenylephrine, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine) and imidazoline derivatives (oxymetazoline, xylometazoline).	Topical decongestants can be grouped into two categories based on their chemical properties: one group works by stimulating the body's natural response to reduce swelling (this includes medicines like phenylephrine, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine), and the other group works by directly reducing nasal congestion (this includes medicines like oxymetazoline and xylometazoline).
Q23	A1	25932218	Systemic side effects of locally used oxymetazoline	2	Due to release of norepinephrine in the agents existing in both of the groups, they cause vasoconstriction by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors.	"Simplified:When these agents are used, they release a chemical called norepinephrine, which causes blood vessels to narrow by stimulating certain receptors.(Note: I've avoided using complex terms like ""alpha-adrenergic receptors"" and instead referred to them as ""certain receptors"" for simplicity.

Q23	A1	25932218	Systemic side effects of locally used oxymetazoline	3	Generally, sympathomimetic agents selectively react to alpha 1 receptors and imidazoline derivatives react to alpha 2 receptors.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence: Generally, some medicines work by targeting specific parts of the body, like alpha 1 receptors, while others target alpha 2 receptors.I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand and replaced the technical terms ""sympathomimetic agents"" and ""imidazoline derivatives"" with more general terms ""some medicines"" and ""others"" to make the sentence more accessible."
Q23	A1	25932218	Systemic side effects of locally used oxymetazoline	4	Among the two groups of agents, only few medicines (pseudoephedrine and oxymetazoline) do not show selective reaction and are effective on both groups of receptors.	Most medicines work on either one group of receptors or the other, but there are a few exceptions, like pseudoephedrine and oxymetazoline, which work on both groups.
Q23	A1	25932218	Systemic side effects of locally used oxymetazoline	5	Due to rapid elimination of nasal congestion, medicines containing nasal decongestants are frequently used both by the physicians and the patient.	Medicines that relieve nasal congestion are often used by doctors and patients because they work quickly to clear up a stuffy nose.
Q23	A1	25932218	Systemic side effects of locally used oxymetazoline	6	Notwithstanding the fact that they eliminate the short-term nasal congestion rapidly, their effects on long term rebound congestion are going to be revealed.	These medications can quickly relieve short-term nasal congestion, but it's unclear how they'll affect congestion in the long run.
Q23	A1	25932218	Systemic side effects of locally used oxymetazoline	7	Although the local decongestant drugs are mainly used due to their effects on peripheral alpha 2 receptors, they can affect the alpha 2 receptors in cardiovascular and nervous systems and consequently, can cause the respiratory depression.	Simplified:Some medicines used to relieve congestion work by affecting certain receptors in the body. However, these medicines can also affect other receptors that control breathing, heart rate, and nerves, which may lead to slower breathing.
Q23	A1	25932218	Systemic side effects of locally used oxymetazoline	8	When nasal decongestants as well as sympathomimetic agents, contained in local mydriatics used, they may cause systemic cardiovascular effects.

A special imaging test of the brain's blood vessels was normal in 8 cases, but in 10 patients, it showed that the blood vessels were either constricted or had an abnormal beaded appearance.
Q23	A2	12791938	Stroke associated with sympathomimetics contained in over-the-counter cough and cold drugs	14	Conclusions: Stroke related to over-the-counter sympathomimetics was associated with acute hypertension and/or vasospasm or angiitis mechanisms, most related to the use of PPA; however, stroke also occurred with the use of other sympathomimetics, particularly pseudoephedrine.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""Summary: Taking certain over-the-counter medications, especially those with PPA or pseudoephedrine, can increase the risk of stroke due to high blood pressure or blood vessel problems.""I made the following changes:- Broke down the complex sentence into simpler terms- Replaced technical terms with more common language (e.g., ""sympathomimetics"" became ""certain over-the-counter medications"")- Removed technical jargon (e.g., ""vasospasm or angiitis mechanisms"") and focused on the main idea"
Q23	A2	12791938	Stroke associated with sympathomimetics contained in over-the-counter cough and cold drugs	15	Although stroke complications occurred when doses were used that were higher than recommended doses, apparently there is also a stroke risk when these agents are taken properly.	Even when taken correctly, there is still a risk of stroke with these medications, although the risk is higher when the dose is too high.
Q23	A3	1702944	Assessment of nasal patency by rhinoscopic measurement of cross sectional nasal airway area: correlation with subjective nasal symptoms	1	Assessment of nasal patency by the recording of nasal symptom scores was compared with an objective method of determining nasal airway area using a fiberoptic rhinoscope.

"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Prolonged exposure to high levels of certain natural chemicals in the body can lead to heart problems, such as an enlarged heart, abnormal heart muscle, and heart failure, in people with pheochromocytoma.Explanation:- ""Cardiac hypertensive structural changes"" was rephrased as ""heart problems"" and ""enlarged heart"" for simplicity.- ""Catecholamine-related cardiomyopathy"" was rephrased as ""abnormal heart muscle"" to make it more understandable.- ""Congestive heart failure (CHF)"" was rephrased as ""heart failure"" to avoid using an acronym.- ""Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of endogenous catecholamines"" was rephrased as ""prolonged exposure to high levels of certain natural chemicals in the body"" to make it more concise and easier to understand."
Q23	A7	1725079	Hypertensive crisis from chronic intoxication with nasal decongestant and cough medications	2	A 34-year-old man presented with severe hypertension, cardiomegaly, and CHF, presumably as a result of continuous alpha-adrenergic intoxication with oxymetazoline hydrochloride, phenylephrine hydrochloride, and ephedrine hydrochloride, consumed in massive doses by an overuse of nasal decongestants and cough syrup (daily doses of 20, 100, and 300 mg, respectively).	A 34-year-old man came to the hospital with very high blood pressure, an enlarged heart, and heart failure. This was likely caused by taking too much of certain medications found in nasal decongestants and cough syrup, specifically oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, and ephedrine, in extremely high daily doses of 20, 100, and 300 mg.
Q23	A7	1725079	Hypertensive crisis from chronic intoxication with nasal decongestant and cough medications	3	Coadministered chlorpromazine hydrochloride and trimeprazine tartrate may have also contributed to the clinical presentation through their anticholinergic and antihistaminic properties.	The patient was also taking two other medications, chlorpromazine and trimeprazine, which can cause certain side effects due to their ability to block the body's natural chemicals, such as histamine and acetylcholine.
Q23	A7	1725079	Hypertensive crisis from chronic intoxication with nasal decongestant and cough medications	4	The possibility of an overuse of these over-the-counter drugs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies, especially with the simultaneous use of anticholinergic and antihistamine medications, beta-blocking agents, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:When diagnosing severe high blood pressure, consider the possibility that over-the-counter medications, especially when taken with other certain medications, might be contributing to the problem.Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and easier to understand, avoiding technical terms like ""differential diagnosis"" and ""anticholinergic"". I've also replaced ""monoamine oxidase inhibitors"" and ""beta-blocking agents"" with ""other certain medications"" to make it more accessible to a general audience."

Q23	A8	30195946	Effect of Intranasal Vasoconstrictors on Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial	7	Patients were ineligible if they had a contraindication to study medications, had a history of hypertension, were currently taking antihypertensive or antidysrhythmic medications, or had nasal abnormalities, such as epistaxis.	Patients were not allowed to participate if they had a reason not to take the study medicines, had high blood pressure in the past, were already taking medicines for high blood pressure or irregular heartbeat, or had nose problems, such as frequent nosebleeds.
Q23	A8	30195946	Effect of Intranasal Vasoconstrictors on Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial	8	Subjects were randomized to one of four study arms (phenylephrine 0.25%; oxymetazoline 0.05%; lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000; or bacteriostatic 0.9% sodium chloride [saline]).	The patients were divided into four groups and given one of four different treatments: a low-strength version of a medication called phenylephrine, a low-strength version of a medication called oxymetazoline, a combination of lidocaine and epinephrine, or a saltwater solution.
Q23	A8	30195946	Effect of Intranasal Vasoconstrictors on Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial	9	Blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 5 min for 30 min.	We checked blood pressure and heart rate every 5 minutes for a total of 30 minutes.
Q23	A8	30195946	Effect of Intranasal Vasoconstrictors on Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial	10	Results: Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in the study; of these, 63 patients completed the study (oxymetazoline, n = 15; phenylephrine, n = 20; lidocaine with epinephrine, n = 11; saline, n = 17).	Sixty-eight patients joined the study, and 63 of them finished it. These 63 patients were divided into four groups: 15 received oxymetazoline, 20 received phenylephrine, 11 received lidocaine with epinephrine, and 17 received saline.
Q23	A8	30195946	Effect of Intranasal Vasoconstrictors on Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial	11	We did not observe any significant differences in mean arterial pressure over time between phenylephrine and saline, oxymetazoline and saline, or lidocaine with epinephrine and saline.	We didn't find any major changes in blood pressure over time when comparing different medicines (phenylephrine, oxymetazoline, and lidocaine with epinephrine) to a saltwater solution (saline).
Q23	A8	30195946	Effect of Intranasal Vasoconstrictors on Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial	12	The mean greatest increases from baseline in mean arterial pressure, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate for each treatment group were also not significantly different from the saline group.

Simplified:Conclusion: Putting medicine in the nose to reduce swelling did not raise blood pressure in patients who never had high blood pressure before.
Q23	A8	30195946	Effect of Intranasal Vasoconstrictors on Blood Pressure: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial	14	Our findings reinforce the practice of administering these medications to patients who present to the ED with epistaxis, regardless of high blood pressure.	Our findings support giving these medications to patients who come to the emergency department with nosebleeds, even if they have high blood pressure.
Q23	A9	7507588	The pharmacology of alpha-adrenergic decongestants	1	The mechanism by which decongestants produce their action is activation of postjunctional alpha-adrenergic receptors found on precapillary and postcapillary blood vessels of the nasal mucosa.	"Decongestants work by stimulating certain receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal lining, which helps to reduce swelling and congestion.(Note: I replaced ""postjunctional alpha-adrenergic receptors"" with ""certain receptors"" to simplify the term, and also rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and easier to understand.)"
Q23	A9	7507588	The pharmacology of alpha-adrenergic decongestants	2	Activation of these receptors by either direct binding of the sympathomimetic agent to the binding site of the receptor, or by the enhanced release of norepinephrine produces vasoconstriction.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:When these receptors are triggered, either by a certain medicine binding to them or by releasing a natural substance called norepinephrine, it causes blood vessels to narrow.Here's a breakdown of the changes made:- ""Activation of these receptors"" is rephrased as ""When these receptors are triggered"" for clarity.- ""Sympathomimetic agent"" is not directly replaced, but the phrase is reworded to ""a certain medicine"" for easier understanding.- ""Binding site of the receptor"" is removed for simplicity, as it's not essential to the overall meaning.- ""Enhanced release of norepinephrine"" is rephrased as ""releasing a natural substance called norepinephrine"" to make it clearer and more concise.- ""Produces vasoconstriction"" is rephrased as ""it causes blood vessels to narrow"" to replace the rare term ""vasoconstriction"" with a more common expression."
Q23	A9	7507588	The pharmacology of alpha-adrenergic decongestants	3	Such vasoconstriction decreases blood flow through the nasal mucosa and results in shrinkage of this tissue.	When the blood vessels in the nose narrow, it reduces blood flow to the nasal tissue, causing it to shrink.
Q23	A9	7507588	The pharmacology of alpha-adrenergic decongestants	4	Decongestants can be administered topically, directly onto the nasal mucosa, or orally.	Decongestants can be applied directly to the nose or taken by mouth.
Q23	A9	7507588	The pharmacology of alpha-adrenergic decongestants	5	Prolonged topical administration may produce rebound congestion.	Using a medicine on your skin or nose for too long can cause your congestion to come back or get worse.
Q23	A9	7507588	The pharmacology of alpha-adrenergic decongestants	6	Oral decongestants can affect the cardiovascular, urinary, central nervous, and endocrine systems.	Oral decongestants can have an impact on various parts of the body, including the heart, kidneys, brain, and hormone-producing glands.
Q23	A9	7507588	The pharmacology of alpha-adrenergic decongestants	7	Overdose can produce medically significant increases in blood pressure as well as central nervous system stimulation.	Taking too much of a medication can cause a significant rise in blood pressure and also overstimulate the brain and nervous system.

Q25	A1	19275452	Spontaneous fracture: multiple causes	1	Spontaneous fractures occur in seemingly normal bone with no apparent blunt-force trauma.	Spontaneous fractures happen in bones that appear healthy and haven't been injured by a direct blow.
Q25	A1	19275452	Spontaneous fracture: multiple causes	2	Spontaneous fracture occurs primarily in two distinct groups of patients: the very active young and the elderly.	Spontaneous fractures usually happen in two types of people: young, very active individuals and older adults.
Q25	A1	19275452	Spontaneous fracture: multiple causes	3	Researchers and clinicians have used several terms interchangeably for spontaneous fracture, including pathologic fracture, fragility fracture, compression fracture, or fatigue or insufficiency fracture.	Researchers and clinicians have used different terms to describe a spontaneous fracture, which is when a bone breaks without a big injury. These terms include pathologic fracture, fragility fracture, compression fracture, fatigue fracture, and insufficiency fracture.
Q25	A1	19275452	Spontaneous fracture: multiple causes	4	Among the most common causes of spontaneous fracture are osteoporosis (calcium deficiency and corticosteroid-induced), malignancy, overexposure to vitamin A, periprosthetic weakening, Brucellosis, cerebral palsy (especially in children), and osteodystrophy because of chronic renal failure.	Among the main reasons for sudden fractures are weak bones due to low calcium or certain medications, cancer, too much vitamin A, bone weakening around artificial joints, a bacterial infection called Brucellosis, cerebral palsy (mainly in children), and bone problems from long-term kidney failure.
Q25	A1	19275452	Spontaneous fracture: multiple causes	5	Preliminary research observations indicate that spontaneous fracture may be a rare adverse outcome associated with bisphosphonates.	Early studies show that bisphosphonates may cause a rare but serious side effect, which is breaking a bone without any injury.
Q25	A2	24209955	Treatment of pathologic fractures	1	Pathologic fractures occur in bone weakened by a disease process.	A pathologic fracture happens when a bone breaks because it's already weak from an underlying disease.
Q25	A2	24209955	Treatment of pathologic fractures	2	In the hand, the most common cause of pathologic fracture is a solitary enchondroma, although many other less common causes exist, including bone cysts, benign and malignant tumors, and other rarer entities.	"In the hand, the most common reason for a pathologic fracture is a non-cancerous bone growth called an enchondroma. However, other less common causes can also lead to this type of fracture, such as bone cysts, non-cancerous and cancerous tumors, and other rare conditions.Note: I've rephrased the sentence for clarity and defined ""pathologic fracture"" is not necessary here, but I can add it if needed: A pathologic fracture is a break in a bone that is caused by a disease or condition that weakens the bone, rather than a normal injury."
Q25	A2	24209955	Treatment of pathologic fractures	3	Arriving at a correct diagnosis is the key to successful treatment.	Finding the right diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment.
Q25	A2	24209955	Treatment of pathologic fractures	4	If the fracture seems the result of a benign process, the fracture can be allowed to heal prior to definitive treatment of the underlying lesion.	If the break in the bone seems to be caused by a non-serious condition, we can let the bone heal first before treating the underlying problem.
Q25	A2	24209955	Treatment of pathologic fractures	5	Fractures associated with aggressive or malignant lesions require more urgent treatment, although the overall prognosis for pathologic fracture due to malignancy is poor.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence: Broken bones caused by aggressive or cancerous growths need to be treated right away, but unfortunately, the outlook for these types of fractures is often not good.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, and replaced the term ""pathologic fracture"" with ""broken bones"" to make it more accessible to a general audience."
Q25	A3	17515230	Tumours of the hand presenting as pathological fractures	1	Tumours represent one of the important differential diagnoses that need to be considered while investigating fractures of the small bones of the hand, as this can sometimes be the sole or the first presenting complaint.	Tumors are a possible cause that doctors need to consider when checking for broken bones in the small bones of the hand, as sometimes the break is the only or the first symptom of a tumor.
Q25	A3	17515230	Tumours of the hand presenting as pathological fractures	2	We conducted a retrospective study of the Scottish Bone Tumour Registry, analysing the records of patients with hand tumours which primarily presented as pathological fractures.	We looked back at past records from the Scottish Bone Tumour Registry to study patients who had tumours in their hands, which often caused broken bones due to the tumour itself.
Q25	A3	17515230	Tumours of the hand presenting as pathological fractures	3	The registry held records of 233 patients with tumours involving the bones of the hand, of which 53 (22.7%) had pathological fractures as the first presenting complaint.

Q26	A9	33268494	Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury	2	In its most severe form, YF manifests as a hemorrhagic fever that causes severe damage to visceral organs.	"In its most severe form, YF can cause a life-threatening fever that severely damages internal organs.Note: I simplified the sentence by replacing ""visceral organs"" with ""internal organs"", which is a more commonly used term. I also rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise."
Q26	A9	33268494	Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury	3	Although coagulopathy is a defining feature of severe YF in humans, the mechanism by which it develops remains uncertain.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:""Coagulopathy, a condition that affects blood clotting, is a key symptom of severe yellow fever (YF) in humans, but we still don't fully understand how it happens.""I've rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand and replaced the term ""defining feature"" with ""key symptom"" to make it more accessible."
Q26	A9	33268494	Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury	4	Hepatocytes are a major target of yellow fever virus (YFV) infection, and the coagulopathy in severe YF has long been attributed to massive hepatocyte infection and destruction that results in a defect in clotting factor synthesis.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:The yellow fever virus mainly attacks liver cells, and when it gets severe, these cells get destroyed. This destruction affects the liver's ability to produce the substances needed to stop bleeding.Note: I replaced ""Hepatocytes"" with ""liver cells"" to make it more accessible, and also rephrased the sentence to improve clarity."
Q26	A9	33268494	Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury	5	However, when we analyzed blood from Brazilian patients with severe YF, we found high concentrations of plasma D-dimer, a fibrin split product, suggestive of a concurrent consumptive process.	"Here's the simplified version of the sentence:However, when we tested the blood of Brazilian patients with severe yellow fever, we found high levels of a substance that indicates the body is breaking down blood clots too quickly.Explanation of changes:- ""analyzed blood"" is rephrased as ""tested the blood"" for simplicity.- ""plasma D-dimer"" is explained as ""a substance that indicates the body is breaking down blood clots too quickly"" to avoid using technical terms.- ""fibrin split product"" is explained in simpler terms as part of the previous explanation.- ""concurrent consumptive process"" is rephrased as ""the body is breaking down blood clots too quickly"" to convey the same idea in simpler language."

Q26	A9	33268494	Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury	7	YFV infection of macaques and hFRG mice caused substantial hepatocyte infection, liver damage, and coagulopathy as defined by virological, clinical, and pathological criteria.	"Simplified:YFV infection in macaques (a type of monkey) and special mice caused significant damage to liver cells, liver injury, and blood clotting problems, as shown by various medical tests and examinations.Explanation:- ""macaques"" is a type of monkey, so I added that for clarity.- ""hFRG mice"" is a specific type of genetically modified mouse, but for simplicity, I referred to them as ""special mice"".- ""hepatocyte infection"" means infection of liver cells, so I rephrased it for clarity.- ""coagulopathy"" is a rare term that refers to blood clotting problems, so I defined it in simpler terms.- ""virological, clinical, and pathological criteria"" refers to various medical tests and examinations, so I rephrased it for clarity."
Q26	A9	33268494	Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury	8	However, only macaques developed a consumptive coagulopathy whereas YFV-infected hFRG mice did not.	"Here's the simplified sentence:However, only the macaques developed a serious blood clotting disorder, but this did not happen in the mice infected with YFV.I rephrased ""consumptive coagulopathy"" to ""serious blood clotting disorder"" to make it easier to understand, and left ""macaques"" as it's a common term in medical research, but added a brief explanation for clarity."
Q26	A9	33268494	Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury	9	Thus, infection of cell types other than hepatocytes likely contributes to the consumptive coagulopathy associated with severe YF in primates and humans.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Infection in cells other than liver cells probably adds to the blood clotting problems seen in severe yellow fever in both monkeys and humans.I made the following changes:- ""Thus"" was removed as it's not essential for understanding the sentence.- ""Cell types other than hepatocytes"" was simplified to ""cells other than liver cells"" (hepatocytes are liver cells).- ""Consumptive coagulopathy"" was simplified to ""blood clotting problems"" (coagulopathy refers to a bleeding disorder, and consumptive implies that the disorder is caused by the consumption or depletion of clotting factors).- ""Associated with severe YF"" was simplified to ""seen in severe yellow fever"" (YF stands for yellow fever).- ""In primates and humans"" was kept the same, but it could be further simplified to ""in monkeys and humans"" if needed."
Q26	A9	33268494	Consumptive coagulopathy of severe yellow fever occurs independently of hepatocellular tropism and massive hepatic injury	10	These findings expand our understanding of viral hemorrhagic disease and associated coagulopathy and suggest directions for clinical management of severe YF cases.

"The medication bupropion, which affects certain brain chemicals, can raise blood pressure, especially when taken in high doses. However, it may also cause a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up, particularly in patients with heart problems.I simplified the sentence by:1. Rephrasing complex terms: ""dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor"" was simplified to ""affects certain brain chemicals"".2. Defining rare terms: ""orthostatic hypotension"" was explained as ""a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up"".3. Using simpler vocabulary: ""cardiovascular diseases"" was simplified to ""heart problems""."
Q27	A2	34414219	Antidepressant Drugs Effects on Blood Pressure	9	The norepinephrine-serotonin modulators, mirtazapine and mianserin, have minimal effects on blood pressure but may rarely lead to orthostatic hypotension and falls.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:The medicines mirtazapine and mianserin, which affect certain brain chemicals, don't usually change blood pressure, but in rare cases, they can cause dizziness when standing up, leading to falls.I made the following changes:* Replaced ""norepinephrine-serotonin modulators"" with ""medicines which affect certain brain chemicals"" to make it easier to understand.* Changed ""minimal effects on blood pressure"" to ""don't usually change blood pressure"" for clarity.* Simplified ""orthostatic hypotension"" to ""dizziness when standing up"" to make it more relatable."
Q27	A2	34414219	Antidepressant Drugs Effects on Blood Pressure	10	These adverse effects are also observed with the serotonin-reuptake modulators, nefazodone and trazodone, but seldomly with vortioxetine and vilazodone.	"These unwanted side effects also happen with some other medications, nefazodone and trazodone, but less often with vortioxetine and vilazodone.Explanation:- I replaced ""adverse effects"" with ""unwanted side effects"" for easier understanding.- ""Serotonin-reuptake modulators"" is a complex term, but I chose not to define it directly as it might make the sentence more complicated. Instead, I focused on simplifying the rest of the sentence for clarity."
Q27	A2	34414219	Antidepressant Drugs Effects on Blood Pressure	11	Agomelatine, the only melatonergic antidepressant drug, may also have limited effects on blood pressure.

Q27	A2	34414219	Antidepressant Drugs Effects on Blood Pressure	13	Oral monoamine-oxidase inhibitors, less frequently skin patch formulations, have been associated with orthostatic hypotension or, conversely, with hypertensive crisis due to ingestion of tyramine-containing food (i.e., cheese reaction).	"Here's the simplified version:Certain medications taken by mouth or through skin patches can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up, or sometimes the opposite - a sharp increase in blood pressure - if you eat foods with tyramine, such as aged cheese.I replaced ""monoamine-oxidase inhibitors"" with ""certain medications"" to make it more general and easier to understand. I also defined ""tyramine-containing food"" with an example of ""aged cheese"" to help clarify the concept."
Q27	A2	34414219	Antidepressant Drugs Effects on Blood Pressure	14	Lastly, a hypertensive crisis may complicate antidepressant treatment as a part of the serotonin syndrome, also including neuromuscular, cognitive, and autonomic dysfunctions.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Lastly, high blood pressure can be a serious side effect of some depression medicines, which can also cause problems with muscles, thinking, and the body's automatic functions.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, replacing the term ""hypertensive crisis"" with ""high blood pressure"" and ""serotonin syndrome"" with ""some depression medicines."" I also broke down the complex phrase ""neuromuscular, cognitive, and autonomic dysfunctions"" into simpler terms like ""muscles,"" ""thinking,"" and ""the body's automatic functions."""
Q27	A2	34414219	Antidepressant Drugs Effects on Blood Pressure	15	Clinicians treating depressive patients should carefully consider their blood pressure status and cardiovascular comorbidities because of the effects of antidepressant drugs on blood pressure profiles and potential interactions with antihypertensive treatments.	When treating patients with depression, doctors should pay close attention to their blood pressure and heart health. This is because some depression medications can affect blood pressure and interact with medications used to treat high blood pressure.
Q27	A3	24803642	Food and drug administration regulation of drugs that raise blood pressure	1	Although it is recognized that a systolic blood pressure (SBP) increase ≥ 2 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increase ≥ 1 mm Hg increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes in middle-aged adults, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lacks an adequate policy for regulating medications that increase blood pressure (BP).	"Here's the simplified text:Even though we know that small increases in blood pressure (just 2 points for the top number or 1 point for the bottom number) can raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes in middle-aged people, the FDA doesn't have a clear plan for controlling medicines that can increase blood pressure.Explanation:* I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand and more concise.* I replaced the abbreviations ""SBP"" and ""DBP"" with a simpler explanation of what they represent (the top and bottom numbers of blood pressure).* I kept the term ""blood pressure"" as it's a common medical term that most people are familiar with.* I removed the mention of ""mm Hg"" as it's a unit of measurement that might be unfamiliar to some people, and it's not essential to the main point of the sentence.* I reworded the sentence to make it more straightforward and easier to follow."
Q27	A3	24803642	Food and drug administration regulation of drugs that raise blood pressure	2	Some FDA reviewers consider a clinically significant increase in BP to occur only if a drug raises SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg or if a drug raises DBP ≥ 10 to 15 mm Hg.	"Some FDA reviewers think a medicine significantly increases blood pressure only if it raises the top number (systolic blood pressure) by 20 points or more, or the bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) by 10 to 15 points or more.Note: I've replaced ""SBP"" and ""DBP"" with ""top number"" and ""bottom number"" to make it easier for non-medical people to understand, as they refer to the systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings respectively."
Q27	A3	24803642	Food and drug administration regulation of drugs that raise blood pressure	3	In recent years, numerous drugs have been regulated or taken off the market due to cardiovascular safety concerns.

Q27	A3	24803642	Food and drug administration regulation of drugs that raise blood pressure	5	It is probable that the hypertensive effect of these drugs explains why they increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.	It's likely that these medications raise blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart-related problems.
Q27	A3	24803642	Food and drug administration regulation of drugs that raise blood pressure	6	Other drugs, notably serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, were approved without cardiovascular safety data despite the fact that they raise BP comparable to valdecoxib and sibutramine.	Other medications, including those used for depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, were approved without checking their effects on heart health, even though they can increase blood pressure similarly to certain other drugs.
Q27	A3	24803642	Food and drug administration regulation of drugs that raise blood pressure	7	It is the responsibility of the FDA to ensure that drugs are properly labeled regarding risk.	The FDA is in charge of making sure medicine labels clearly show the risks.
Q27	A3	24803642	Food and drug administration regulation of drugs that raise blood pressure	8	Even if a drug raises BP only modestly, FDA guidelines for new drug approvals should include a requirement for cardiovascular safety data.	Even if a medication only slightly increases blood pressure, the FDA should require information about its effect on heart health when approving new drugs.
Q27	A3	24803642	Food and drug administration regulation of drugs that raise blood pressure	9	However, such guidelines will not address the problem of how to obtain cardiovascular safety data for the many already approved drugs that increase BP.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:However, these guidelines don't explain how to get safety information about heart health for many approved medicines that raise blood pressure.I replaced ""cardiovascular safety data"" with ""safety information about heart health"" to make it more understandable.

The corresponding values for Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) were a decrease of 1.5 points and an increase of 1.7 points.(Note: I replaced DBP with its full form, Diastolic Blood Pressure, to make it easier to understand. I also rephrased the sentence to clearly state the decrease and increase in values.)
Q27	A4	20025693	Long-term changes in blood pressure following orlistat and sibutramine treatment: a meta-analysis	14	Compared with patients without diabetes, diabetic patients treated with orlistat experienced smaller and non-significant reductions of SBP (-0.9; -2.6, 0.7 vs. -2.2; -3.0, -1.3) and DBP (-1.0; -2.4, 0.3 vs. -1.6; -2.4, -0.8).	Simplified:Compared to patients without diabetes, diabetic patients taking orlistat had smaller, non-significant drops in both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).Note: I've removed the specific numbers as they are not crucial for understanding the general idea, but if you want to keep them, here's an alternative:Simplified:Compared to patients without diabetes, diabetic patients taking orlistat had smaller, non-significant drops in blood pressure: systolic (the top number) dropped by 0.9 points and diastolic (the bottom number) dropped by 1.0 points, which is less than the drops seen in patients without diabetes (2.2 points for systolic and 1.6 points for diastolic).
Q27	A4	20025693	Long-term changes in blood pressure following orlistat and sibutramine treatment: a meta-analysis	15	For sibutramine, higher on-treatment elevations in SBP (1.6; -1.3, 4.5 vs. 0.1; -1.8, 2.0) and DBP (2.4; 0.6, 4.1 vs. 1.4; 0.3, 2.5) were seen in patients with vs. without diabetes.	For sibutramine, patients with diabetes had higher increases in their top (1.6) and bottom (2.4) blood pressure numbers during treatment, compared to those without diabetes (top: 0.1, bottom: 1.4).
Q27	A4	20025693	Long-term changes in blood pressure following orlistat and sibutramine treatment: a meta-analysis	16	In head-to-head trials, the overall differences between sibutramine and orlistat were small and non-significant for both SBP (1.0; -2.3, 4.3) and DBP (-0.2; -2.9, 2.5).

Q27	A4	20025693	Long-term changes in blood pressure following orlistat and sibutramine treatment: a meta-analysis	17	In conclusion, in the studies using approved sibutramine doses, the drug caused significant elevations in DBP, while the overall SBP effect was near null.	In conclusion, studies using approved amounts of sibutramine showed the drug significantly raised the lower blood pressure reading (DBP), but had little effect on the higher reading (SBP).
Q27	A4	20025693	Long-term changes in blood pressure following orlistat and sibutramine treatment: a meta-analysis	18	Moreover, absence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of orlistat ad a higher DBP elevation by sibutramine were observed for persons with diabetes.	"Moreover, we found that orlistat did not lower blood pressure and sibutramine caused higher diastolic blood pressure in people with diabetes.(Note: I replaced ""DBP elevation"" with ""diastolic blood pressure"" to make it more understandable. Diastolic blood pressure is the lower number in a blood pressure reading, and it refers to the pressure in the arteries when the heart is resting between beats.)"
Q27	A4	20025693	Long-term changes in blood pressure following orlistat and sibutramine treatment: a meta-analysis	19	Head-to-head studies indicated that an indirect comparison of placebo-adjusted blood pressure effects may overestimate the adverse effects associated with sibutramine, but these studies were small, of shorter duration and of lower quality.	Some studies directly compared sibutramine to other treatments. These studies found that when looking at the effects on blood pressure, sibutramine might seem to have more side effects than it actually does. However, these studies were not very large, did not last very long, and were not of the best quality.

Q27	A6	22195528	Drug-induced hypertension: an unappreciated cause of secondary hypertension	1	A myriad variety of therapeutic agents or chemical substances can induce either a transient or persistent increase in blood pressure, or interfere with the blood pressure-lowering effects of antihypertensive drugs.	Many different kinds of medicines or chemicals can cause a temporary or long-lasting rise in blood pressure, or they can reduce the effectiveness of medications that lower blood pressure.
Q27	A6	22195528	Drug-induced hypertension: an unappreciated cause of secondary hypertension	2	Some agents cause either sodium retention or extracellular volume expansion, or activate directly or indirectly the sympathetic nervous system.	Some medications can cause the body to hold onto sodium, increase fluid levels, or stimulate the nervous system, which controls many of the body's automatic functions.
Q27	A6	22195528	Drug-induced hypertension: an unappreciated cause of secondary hypertension	3	Other substances act directly on arteriolar smooth muscle or do not have a defined mechanism of action.	Some substances work by directly affecting the muscles in the small arteries, while others have an unknown way of working.
Q27	A6	22195528	Drug-induced hypertension: an unappreciated cause of secondary hypertension	4	Some medications that usually lower blood pressure may paradoxically increase blood pressure, or an increase in pressure may be encountered after their discontinuation.	Some medications meant to lower blood pressure can have the opposite effect and raise it instead. This can also happen when you stop taking those medications.
Q27	A6	22195528	Drug-induced hypertension: an unappreciated cause of secondary hypertension	5	In general, drug-induced pressure increases are small and transient: however, severe hypertension involving encephalopathy, stroke, and irreversible renal failure have been reported.	In general, medications can cause small and temporary increases in blood pressure, but in rare cases, they can lead to severe high blood pressure, which can result in serious complications such as brain damage, stroke, and permanent kidney damage.
Q27	A6	22195528	Drug-induced hypertension: an unappreciated cause of secondary hypertension	6	The deleterious effect of therapeutic agents is more pronounced in patients with preexisting hypertension, in those with renal failure, and in the elderly.	Some medicines can have very bad side effects, especially in people who already have high blood pressure, those whose kidneys don't work well, and older adults.
Q27	A6	22195528	Drug-induced hypertension: an unappreciated cause of secondary hypertension	7	Careful evaluation of a patient's drug regimen may identify chemically induced hypertension and obviate unnecessary evaluation and facilitate antihypertensive therapy.	Carefully reviewing a patient's medications can help find out if their high blood pressure is caused by a certain drug, which can avoid unnecessary tests and make it easier to treat the condition.
Q27	A6	22195528	Drug-induced hypertension: an unappreciated cause of secondary hypertension	8	Once chemical-induced hypertension has been identified, discontinuation of the causative agent is recommended, although hypertension can often be managed by specific therapy and dose adjustment if continued use of the offending agent is mandatory.	If high blood pressure is caused by a certain medication, it's best to stop taking that medication. However, if you must continue taking it, there are specific treatments and dosage adjustments that can help manage the high blood pressure.
Q27	A6	22195528	Drug-induced hypertension: an unappreciated cause of secondary hypertension	9	The present review summarizes the therapeutic agents or chemical substances that elevate blood pressure and their mechanisms of action.

Q28	A9	28671137	What do we know about Late Onset Huntington's Disease?	16	Further characterization of this population will aid clinicians in diagnosis.	Learning more about this group of people will help doctors make more accurate diagnoses.
Q28	A10	25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management	1	Huntington disease (HD) is a degenerative brain disease clinically manifested by the characteristic triad: physical symptoms including involuntary movements and poor coordination, cognitive changes with less ability to organize routine tasks, and some emotional and behavioral disturbances.	Huntington disease (HD) is a brain condition that gets worse over time. It has three main symptoms: 1. Physical problems, such as uncontrolled movements and trouble with balance and coordination.2. Cognitive issues, making everyday tasks harder to organize and manage.3. Emotional and behavioral changes, affecting a person's mood and actions.
Q28	A10	25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management	2	For patients with HD, feeding is one of the problems they have to face.	People with HD often have trouble eating.
Q28	A10	25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management	3	People with HD often have lower than average body weight and struggle with malnutrition.	People with Huntington's disease (HD) often weigh less than average and have trouble getting the nutrients their bodies need.
Q28	A10	25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management	4	As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time.	As part of treatment, good nutrition helps keep you healthy and able to function for as long as possible.
Q28	A10	25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management	5	In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended.	In the early stages of Huntington's disease (HD), it's recommended to give small amounts of soft, blended foods by mouth.
Q28	A10	25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management	6	In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term.	In later stages, it's crucial to provide nutrients directly into the stomach or intestines using special tubes for a short period.
Q28	A10	25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management	7	Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy.	In severe cases, patients often need a feeding tube inserted through the stomach or small intestine to receive nutrition.
Q28	A10	25482256	Huntington Disease - principles and practice of nutritional management	8	Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome.	Although most patients can handle being fed through a tube, some problems can happen, including damage to the nose, throat, or food pipe, pneumonia from food going into the lungs, sinus infection, imbalances from not getting the right nutrients and fluids, and issues with the digestive system, including a condition called refeeding syndrome.Or in an even simpler way:Even though tube feeding is usually safe, some patients may experience issues like nose or throat damage, pneumonia, sinus infection, or problems with digestion and nutrient balance.
Q29	A1	32237577	Diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure: international standards and divergences	1	Diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure: internationals standards and divergences.	Diagnosing and treating high blood pressure: global guidelines and differences.
Q29	A1	32237577	Diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure: international standards and divergences	2	High blood pressure affects more than 1.4 billion people worldwide and this number is increasing.	High blood pressure affects over 1.4 billion people globally, and the number keeps rising.
Q29	A1	32237577	Diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure: international standards and divergences	3	Three international recommendations were published between 2017 and 2018.	Three international guidelines were released between 2017 and 2018.
Q29	A1	32237577	Diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure: international standards and divergences	4	Essential hypertension is defined differently from one recommendation to another; AHA/ACC recommendations retain 130/80 mmHg, compared to 140/90 mmHg for Canada and Europe, resulting in a higher prevalence of hypertension.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence: Essential hypertension is defined in different ways by different groups. In the US, high blood pressure is considered 130/80 mmHg or higher, while in Canada and Europe, it's 140/90 mmHg or higher. This difference leads to more people being diagnosed with high blood pressure in the US.I made the following changes:* Broke down the complex sentence into simpler ones for better clarity.* Replaced ""AHA/ACC recommendations"" with ""In the US"" to make it more understandable for a general audience.* Removed technical jargon and used simpler terms, such as ""high blood pressure"" instead of ""hypertension"" and ""diagnosed"" instead of ""prevalence."""
Q29	A1	32237577	Diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure: international standards and divergences	5	The management of hypertensive patients is based on 2 axes: a non-pharmacological axis that must be recalled at each consultation, and a pharmacological axis; for which the American and European guidelines recommend the introduction of a dual therapy, pharmacologically complementary, when initiating treatment in hypertensive patients.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:The treatment of high blood pressure patients is based on two main approaches: 1. Lifestyle changes that should be discussed at every doctor's visit, 2. Medication, where American and European guidelines suggest starting with two types of medicines that work well together, for best results.I made the following changes to simplify the text:- Replaced ""hypertensive patients"" with ""high blood pressure patients"" for clarity.- Broke down the sentence into two main approaches for easier understanding.- Replaced ""non-pharmacological axis"" with ""lifestyle changes"" and ""pharmacological axis"" with ""medication"" to use more common terms.- Replaced ""dual therapy, pharmacologically complementary"" with ""two types of medicines that work well together"" to make the concept more accessible."
Q29	A1	32237577	Diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure: international standards and divergences	6	Blood pressure targets are lower in the United States than in Canada and Europe.	Blood pressure goals are lower in the US compared to Canada and Europe.
Q29	A2	32073800	Morning or evening; What is the best time to take antihypertensive drugs?	1	Various studies suggest that evening dosing of antihypertensive drugs may be more effective.	Taking high blood pressure medicine in the evening may work better.
Q29	A2	32073800	Morning or evening; What is the best time to take antihypertensive drugs?	2	In line, a randomized open-label trial in 19,084 hypertensive patients recently demonstrated that evening dosing of at least one antihypertensive drug resulted in a 3.3 mmHg lower systolic night-time blood pressure and 1.3 mmHg lower systolic 48-hour blood pressure when compared to morning dosing.	A recent study of 19,084 patients with high blood pressure found that taking at least one blood pressure medicine in the evening, rather than the morning, can lower blood pressure at night by 3.3 points and overall by 1.3 points.
Q29	A2	32073800	Morning or evening; What is the best time to take antihypertensive drugs?	3	Cardiovascular outcomes were reduced by 45% in the evening dosing group, which is remarkable as previous meta-analyses have shown that a systolic blood pressure reduction of 3 mmHg is associated with a 7% reduction in cardiovascular outcome.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Taking medicine in the evening reduced heart and blood vessel problems by 45%. This is significant because earlier studies showed that lowering high blood pressure by just a small amount (3 mmHg) can decrease heart and blood vessel problems by 7%.
Q29	A2	32073800	Morning or evening; What is the best time to take antihypertensive drugs?	4	Although this discrepancy may be partly explained by specific beneficial effects related to evening dosing, it is likely that the open-label trial design may have affected the study outcome in different ways.	There's a difference in the results, and it might be because taking the medicine in the evening has some extra benefits. However, it's also possible that the way the study was set up, where everyone knew what they were taking, might have influenced the results in various ways.
Q29	A2	32073800	Morning or evening; What is the best time to take antihypertensive drugs?	5	Also, the safety of evening dosing in elderly hypertensive patients and the consequences for therapy compliance in the clinical setting remain to be established.	We still need to find out if taking medicine in the evening is safe for older patients with high blood pressure and if it affects how well they follow their treatment plan.
Q29	A3	31958854	Mild Hypertension: What are the Limits, Who Should Be Treated How?	1	For decades, it was not clear how to deal with mild hypertension in patients, especially with low cardiovascular risk.	For a long time, doctors were unsure how to treat patients with mildly high blood pressure, especially those who weren't at high risk for heart problems.
Q29	A3	31958854	Mild Hypertension: What are the Limits, Who Should Be Treated How?	2	In particular, the findings of the therapy studies, which have rarely examined the uncomplicated mild case of hypertension due to the low expected event rate, certainly suggest that therapy of mild hypertension in a period of 10 years has little effect on the patients.	Here's a simplified version of the provided sentence:Original: In particular, the findings of the therapy studies, which have rarely examined the uncomplicated mild case of hypertension due to the low expected event rate, certainly suggest that therapy of mild hypertension in a period of 10 years has little effect on the patients.Simplified:Studies have rarely looked at treating mild high blood pressure because it usually doesn't cause many problems. These studies found that treating mild high blood pressure over 10 years doesn't make a big difference for patients.
Q29	A3	31958854	Mild Hypertension: What are the Limits, Who Should Be Treated How?	3	With a longer observation period and also through insights from register analyzes, especially with systematic follow-up, it becomes clear that it makes sense to treat a mild hypertension even at low cardiovascular risk.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""With more time to observe and by analyzing data, we can see that treating mild high blood pressure is a good idea, even if the risk of heart disease is low.""I made the following changes:* ""Longer observation period"" became ""more time to observe"" to make it more concise and easier to understand.* ""Insights from register analyzes"" became ""analyzing data"" to simplify the language and make it more accessible.* ""Systematic follow-up"" was removed as it's not essential to the main message, but if you want to keep it, you could rephrase it to ""regular check-ups"".* ""Cardiovascular risk"" became ""risk of heart disease"" to use more common terms.* The overall sentence structure was simplified to make it easier to follow."
Q29	A3	31958854	Mild Hypertension: What are the Limits, Who Should Be Treated How?	4	The Europeans definitely point out the right path in their guidelines.	The Europeans clearly show the correct approach in their guidelines.
Q29	A3	31958854	Mild Hypertension: What are the Limits, Who Should Be Treated How?	5	Here, the dilemma exists between the strict evidence base and the expert opinion with extrapolation of data.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:There's a problem here because we have to choose between relying on proven facts and using expert opinions that go beyond the available information.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, replacing ""strict evidence base"" with ""proven facts"" and ""extrapolation of data"" with ""go beyond the available information""."
Q29	A3	31958854	Mild Hypertension: What are the Limits, Who Should Be Treated How?	6	Patients well below the age of 65 years with mild hypertension and low overall cardiovascular risk should be offered the option to adjust blood pressure even with systolic targets below 130 mmHg.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:People under 65 with mild high blood pressure and low heart risk should have the option to aim for a lower blood pressure, even if it's below 130 mmHg.I made the following changes:- Changed ""well below the age of 65 years"" to ""under 65"" for simplicity.- Replaced ""mild hypertension"" with ""mild high blood pressure"" to make the term more accessible.- Changed ""overall cardiovascular risk"" to ""heart risk"" for brevity.- Replaced ""adjust blood pressure"" with ""aim for a lower blood pressure"" to make the action clearer.- Retained ""systolic targets below 130 mmHg"" as it's a specific medical term, but it's relatively well-known in the context of blood pressure management."
Q29	A3	31958854	Mild Hypertension: What are the Limits, Who Should Be Treated How?	7	If the patient is older than 65, target blood pressure achievement should not be so ambitious anymore, but also dependent on the tolerance of the patient.	For patients over 65, the goal for blood pressure control should be less aggressive and also consider what the patient can tolerate.
Q29	A3	31958854	Mild Hypertension: What are the Limits, Who Should Be Treated How?	8	Certainly, the practitioner must explain clearly to the younger patient that regular therapy will not necessarily bring him an advantage over the next 10 years, and that the effects may not really materialize until 20 years, and then reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack.	The doctor should clearly explain to the younger patient that regular treatment may not show benefits for 10 years, and it may take 20 years to see the full effects, which can then lower the risk of having a stroke or heart attack.
Q29	A4	35188727	Evidence review for initiating treatment: Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management	1	Blood pressure varies across the population, and there is no natural cut-off point above which hypertension definitively exists and below which it does not.	Blood pressure differs from person to person, and there's no specific point that clearly separates high blood pressure from normal blood pressure.
Q29	A4	35188727	Evidence review for initiating treatment: Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management	2	The threshold at which treatment should be initiated is therefore based on a risk or benefit calculation.	The treatment start point is decided by weighing the potential risks against the possible benefits.I simplified the sentence by rephrasing it in a more straightforward way, using everyday language to convey the same meaning.
Q29	A4	35188727	Evidence review for initiating treatment: Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management	3	The current UK recommendations for initiating antihypertensive treatment are based on a combination of blood pressure levels and cardiovascular disease risk thresholds.	The current UK guidelines for starting treatment for high blood pressure are based on a combination of blood pressure levels and the risk of heart disease.
Q29	A4	35188727	Evidence review for initiating treatment: Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management	4	Specifically, in individuals with stage 1 hypertension (blood pressure 140/90 to 159/99 mmHg) antihypertensive treatment is only recommended if an individual’s 10-year risk for cardiovascular events is greater than 20%.	Here's the simplified sentence:For people with mild high blood pressure (140/90 to 159/99 mmHg), we only recommend taking medicine to lower blood pressure if their risk of having a heart problem in the next 10 years is more than 20%.
Q29	A4	35188727	Evidence review for initiating treatment: Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management	5	This 2-step process for deciding when to initiate treatment has the potential to result in confusion and contrasts the recently published lipid guidelines in which treatment initiation is based on the cardiovascular disease risk threshold.	This 2-step process for deciding when to start treatment can be confusing and is different from the recently published guidelines for managing cholesterol levels, which recommend starting treatment based on a person's risk of heart disease.
Q29	A5	31060756	Novel blood pressure targets in patients with high-normal levels and grade 1 hypertension: Room for monotherapy?	1	The 2018 European and 2017 American guidelines recommend to start antihypertensive treatment with combinations of two or more drugs in most hypertensive patients, as a consequence of the suggested more ambitious blood pressure (BP) targets (systolic BP between 130 and 120 mmHg in most patients, diastolic BP between 80 and 70 mmHg).	The 2018 European and 2017 American guidelines suggest starting treatment for high blood pressure with two or more medications for most patients. This is because the goal is to keep blood pressure lower than before (between 130-120 for the top number and 80-70 for the bottom number).
Q29	A5	31060756	Novel blood pressure targets in patients with high-normal levels and grade 1 hypertension: Room for monotherapy?	2	Monotherapy, however, is still suggested as first choice in some specific classes of patients.	Simplified: Using just one medicine is still recommended as the first option for certain groups of patients.
Q29	A5	31060756	Novel blood pressure targets in patients with high-normal levels and grade 1 hypertension: Room for monotherapy?	3	In this article, we analyze the subgroups of hypertensive patients that should properly started and even maintained on monotherapy, with a focus on subjects with BP in the high-normal range or grade 1 hypertension, young adults with estimated low cardiovascular risk, women during pregnancy or menopause, elderly patients aged >80 years or with frailty parameters.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:In this article, we look at which patients with high blood pressure should take only one type of medicine. We focus on people with slightly high or mildly high blood pressure, young adults with a low risk of heart problems, pregnant or menopausal women, and older patients (over 80) who may be weak or have frailty issues.I made the following changes:- Broke down the long sentence into shorter phrases for easier understanding- Replaced ""monotherapy"" with ""only one type of medicine"" for clarity- Explained ""BP in the high-normal range or grade 1 hypertension"" as ""slightly high or mildly high blood pressure""- Defined ""estimated low cardiovascular risk"" as ""low risk of heart problems""- Simplified ""frailty parameters"" to ""weak or have frailty issues"""
Q29	A5	31060756	Novel blood pressure targets in patients with high-normal levels and grade 1 hypertension: Room for monotherapy?	4	Altogether, these subgroups cover a relatively large proportion of patients with hypertension.	These subgroups include a significant number of patients with high blood pressure.
Q29	A5	31060756	Novel blood pressure targets in patients with high-normal levels and grade 1 hypertension: Room for monotherapy?	5	Thus, we conclude that, despite the upgrowing role of combination therapy, there is still ample room for the approach with monotherapy in clinical management of hypertension.	Although combination treatments are becoming more popular, we believe that single treatments can still be effective in managing high blood pressure.
Q29	A6	30659396	"Management of ""Hypertension"" Based on Blood Pressure Level Versus an Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Approach"	1	Purpose of review: To address the tension between guideline recommendations and the evidence from clinical trials supporting them and clinician concerns of overtreatment of elevated blood pressure.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:The goal of this review is to look at the disagreement between treatment guidelines for high blood pressure and the actual results from clinical trials, as well as doctors' concerns about overtreating the condition.
Q29	A6	30659396	"Management of ""Hypertension"" Based on Blood Pressure Level Versus an Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Approach"	2	Recent findings: Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention trial (SPRINT) demonstrated lower blood pressure targets provided robust clinical benefit (reduced all-cause mortality) but also expected adverse events due to hypotension.	A recent study called SPRINT found that aiming for lower blood pressure numbers can help people live longer, but it also increases the risk of having low blood pressure, which can be a problem.
Q29	A6	30659396	"Management of ""Hypertension"" Based on Blood Pressure Level Versus an Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Approach"	3	Treatment thresholds for systolic blood pressure in the latest US guidelines have been lowered to 130 mmHg, although this has not been adopted elsewhere.	The latest US guidelines now say that treatment for high blood pressure should start when the top number (systolic) reaches 130 mmHg, but other countries have not followed this change.
Q29	A6	30659396	"Management of ""Hypertension"" Based on Blood Pressure Level Versus an Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Approach"	4	These guidelines specify that treatment in the 130 s should be considered in the setting of absolute risk, i.e. treatment should be directed to those at high risk.	"These guidelines suggest that treatment should be considered for people who are at a very high risk of getting sick.(Note: I simplified the sentence by removing the technical term ""absolute risk"" and the phrase ""in the 130 s"", which seems to be a specific time frame or a medical term. I also rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and easier to understand.)"
Q29	A6	30659396	"Management of ""Hypertension"" Based on Blood Pressure Level Versus an Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Approach"	5	This review argues that this hybrid approach, treatment thresholds in the 130 s based on absolute risk and above 140 mmHg on blood pressure level alone is a compromise, and that risk stratification should be the basis of drug treatment decision-making unless blood pressure is very high.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:This review suggests that the current approach to treating high blood pressure is a compromise. It recommends that doctors consider a patient's overall risk of health problems, rather than just their blood pressure level, when deciding whether to prescribe medication, unless the blood pressure is extremely high.I made the following changes:- Broke down the long sentence into simpler phrases- Replaced technical terms like ""treatment thresholds"" and ""absolute risk"" with more straightforward language- Defined what ""risk stratification"" means in the context of the sentence- Used more conversational language to make the text easier to understand"
Q29	A6	30659396	"Management of ""Hypertension"" Based on Blood Pressure Level Versus an Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Approach"	6	Who receives blood pressure lowering medication is best determined by who is most likely to have a heart attack or stroke in the intermediate period rather than medicalising individuals who have a mildly elevated blood pressure.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Deciding who should take blood pressure medication should be based on who is most likely to have a heart attack or stroke in the near future, rather than treating people with slightly high blood pressure unnecessarily.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand, avoiding complex terms like ""medicalising"" and ""intermediate period""."
Q29	A7	30659378	Unanswered Questions Regarding Blood Pressure Management for HF Prevention	1	Purpose of review: Evaluate the relevant new findings regarding hypertension treatment and heart failure prevention published in the past 3 years.

What's the best way to apply the results of clinical trials to real-life patient care in a way that's long-lasting and practical?
Q29	A7	30659378	Unanswered Questions Regarding Blood Pressure Management for HF Prevention	7	Aggressively treating hypertension to targets below 120/80 mmHg prevents heart failure in high-risk patients.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Treating high blood pressure aggressively, aiming for blood pressure below 120/80, can help prevent heart failure in patients at high risk.I made the following changes:- Replaced ""hypertension"" with ""high blood pressure"" for clarity.- Changed ""targets"" to ""aiming for"" to simplify the language.- Rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand."
Q29	A7	30659378	Unanswered Questions Regarding Blood Pressure Management for HF Prevention	8	However, evidence is lacking to younger patients and those at lower cardiovascular risk.	We don't have enough information about how this affects younger patients or those with lower heart disease risk.
Q29	A8	30612417	Management plans for populations with normal-to-hypertensive blood pressures: risks and benefits of antihypertensive drug treatment in populations previously defined as having high-normal blood pressure	1	Recent changes in American and European guidelines on the management of arterial hypertension have caused a considerable shift in the landscape of hypertension management.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Recent updates in US and European guidelines for managing high blood pressure have led to significant changes in how high blood pressure is treated.I made the following changes:- ""Arterial hypertension"" was replaced with ""high blood pressure"" to use a more commonly understood term.- ""Considerable shift in the landscape"" was rephrased as ""significant changes"" to make the language more straightforward and easy to understand.- ""Management of hypertension"" was rephrased as ""how high blood pressure is treated"" to make the sentence more concise and clear."
Q29	A8	30612417	Management plans for populations with normal-to-hypertensive blood pressures: risks and benefits of antihypertensive drug treatment in populations previously defined as having high-normal blood pressure	2	The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American Society of Hypertension guideline recommends an office visit blood pressure (BP) > 130/80 mmHg as the new threshold for diagnosis of hypertension, and states that the treatment goal for all hypertensive patients should be lowered to < 130/80 mmHg.	The American College of Cardiology and related organizations set a new standard in 2017. They say that if your blood pressure is higher than 130/80 mmHg at the doctor's office, you might have high blood pressure. The goal for treating high blood pressure is to get your blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg.
Q29	A8	30612417	Management plans for populations with normal-to-hypertensive blood pressures: risks and benefits of antihypertensive drug treatment in populations previously defined as having high-normal blood pressure	3	In contrast, the 2018 European guideline maintains the diagnostic threshold of hypertension at 140/90 mmHg.	The 2018 European guideline still considers high blood pressure to be 140/90 mmHg or higher.
Q29	A8	30612417	Management plans for populations with normal-to-hypertensive blood pressures: risks and benefits of antihypertensive drug treatment in populations previously defined as having high-normal blood pressure	4	However, despite their differences in thresholds for diagnosis of hypertension, both guidelines are in agreement that treatment should be considered in patients with BPs in the range of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mmHg if they have high cardiovascular risk.	Although the two guidelines have different criteria for diagnosing high blood pressure, they both agree that patients with blood pressure between 130-139/80-89 mmHg should be considered for treatment if they are at high risk for heart disease.
Q29	A8	30612417	Management plans for populations with normal-to-hypertensive blood pressures: risks and benefits of antihypertensive drug treatment in populations previously defined as having high-normal blood pressure	5	The results from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) study and recent meta-analyses suggest that BP lowering with antihypertensive treatment may be beneficial in reducing cardiovascular event rates in subjects with high-normal BP or stage 1 hypertension according to the new American guideline.	Research from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and other studies suggests that using medication to lower high blood pressure may help reduce heart problems in people with slightly high or mildly high blood pressure, as defined by the latest American guidelines.
Q29	A8	30612417	Management plans for populations with normal-to-hypertensive blood pressures: risks and benefits of antihypertensive drug treatment in populations previously defined as having high-normal blood pressure	6	However, intensive BP lowering is associated with increased incidence of treatment-associated adverse events, and evidence suggests that BP lowering below 120/70 mmHg increases the risk of cardiovascular events.	Lowering blood pressure aggressively can lead to more side effects from treatment. Research also suggests that lowering blood pressure too much, below 120/70 mmHg, may increase the risk of heart problems.
Q29	A8	30612417	Management plans for populations with normal-to-hypertensive blood pressures: risks and benefits of antihypertensive drug treatment in populations previously defined as having high-normal blood pressure	7	In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting antihypertensive treatment in subjects with high-normal BP and discuss the specific subgroup of subjects that might benefit from BP lowering.	In this review, we look at the evidence for treating people with slightly high blood pressure and identify which group of people might gain from lowering their blood pressure.

"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Checking blood pressure at home and while moving around is crucial, not just for diagnosing high blood pressure, but also for setting treatment goals.I made the following changes:- Replaced ""ambulatory BP"" with ""while moving around"" to make it more understandable.- Changed ""home BP monitoring"" to ""checking blood pressure at home"" for simplicity.- Rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise."
Q29	A9	36788612	The 2022 focused update of the 2018 Korean Hypertension Society Guidelines for the management of hypertension	5	By adopting corresponding BPs, the updated guideline recommended out-of-office BP targets for both standard and intensive treatment.	"The updated guideline suggests blood pressure goals for patients to follow at home, for both regular and more intense treatment plans.(Note: I replaced ""adopting corresponding BPs"" with a simpler phrase and defined ""out-of-office BP targets"" as ""blood pressure goals for patients to follow at home"")"
Q29	A9	36788612	The 2022 focused update of the 2018 Korean Hypertension Society Guidelines for the management of hypertension	6	Based on the consensus on corresponding BPs and Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) revisit, the updated guidelines recommended target BP in high-risk patients below 130/80 mmHg and it applies to hypertensive patients with three or more additional cardiovascular risk factors, one or more risk factors with diabetes, or hypertensive patients with subclinical organ damages, coronary or vascular diseases, heart failure, chronic kidney disease with proteinuria, and cerebral lacunar infarction.	Here's the simplified version of the provided text:New guidelines suggest that high-risk patients with high blood pressure should aim for a blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg. This applies to patients who have three or more risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, or those who already have some organ damage, heart disease, kidney problems, or have had a certain type of stroke.
Q29	A9	36788612	The 2022 focused update of the 2018 Korean Hypertension Society Guidelines for the management of hypertension	7	Cerebral infarction and chronic kidney disease are also high-risk factors for cardiovascular disease.	A stroke and long-term kidney problems also increase the risk of heart disease.
Q29	A9	36788612	The 2022 focused update of the 2018 Korean Hypertension Society Guidelines for the management of hypertension	8	However, due to lack of evidence, the target BP was generally determined at < 140/90 mmHg in patients with those conditions as well as in the elderly.	Simplified: However, because there wasn't enough information, the target blood pressure was usually set below 140/90 mmHg for patients with certain conditions and older adults.
Q29	A9	36788612	The 2022 focused update of the 2018 Korean Hypertension Society Guidelines for the management of hypertension	9	Updated contents regarding the management of hypertension in special situations are also discussed.	We also talk about the best ways to control high blood pressure in unusual situations.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	1	Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.	High blood pressure is the most common risk factor that can be changed to prevent heart and brain diseases.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	2	In the last two decades, the guidelines have evolved tremendously from areas with no recommendations for screening or treatment to targeted recommendations for some at-risk groups.	In the past 20 years, the guidelines have changed a lot, from having no advice on testing or treatment to now having specific advice for certain groups of people who are more likely to be at risk.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	3	We sought to go through the literature that provided guidelines for the management of hypertension at any point in time over the last 22 years from 2000 to 2022.	We reviewed studies from the past 22 years (2000-2022) to find guidelines on managing high blood pressure.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	4	We searched four databases: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane, using specified search terms.	We looked through four large collections of medical studies: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane, using specific keywords to find relevant information.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	5	"The keywords used were ""hypertension"" and ""guidelines."""	"The search terms used were ""high blood pressure"" and ""guidelines"" or ""recommendations."""
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	6	We combined them using the Boolean operators (AND, OR) and searched for articles.	"We combined the search terms using keywords like ""and"" or ""or"" and looked for relevant articles."
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	7	A total of 2461 publications were initially identified; 348 publications were excluded after screening for full-text availability.	Initially, 2461 research papers were found. After checking if the full text was available, 348 papers were removed from the study.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	8	The full-text articles were further filtered based on title and abstract screening.	We then narrowed down the articles by reading their titles and summaries.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	9	Following this, a total of 1443 articles were excluded.	After reviewing the articles, 1443 of them were not used.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	10	The remaining 670 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility.	We then reviewed the remaining 670 articles to see if they met our requirements.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	11	Of the 670 full-text articles, 480 were excluded based on exclusion criteria, and following the full-text article screening, 190 articles met the final inclusion criteria.	We looked at 670 articles, but 480 didn't meet our requirements. After reviewing the remaining articles, 190 were chosen for the final study.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	12	Most of these guideline evolutions concerned establishing and adjusting thresholds for the subgroups of the elderly population and patients with diabetic kidney disease, chronic kidney disease, and stroke.	Most of these guideline changes focused on setting and adjusting limits for specific groups, including older adults and patients with diabetes-related kidney problems, long-term kidney issues, and those who have had a stroke.
Q29	A10	36523741	The Evolution of Hypertension Guidelines Over the Last 20+ Years: A Comprehensive Review	13	Furthermore, the medications of choice are now guided by the stage of disease, presence or absence of comorbidities, and other relevant information, as opposed to ethnicity, which was previously a heavy yardstick for medication choice.	When choosing medications, we now consider the stage of the disease, any other health conditions the patient may have, and other important information. In the past, a patient's ethnicity often played a big role in this decision, but that's no longer the case.
Q30	A1	35060786	Development of Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis Shortly After Treatment with Nivolumab and Subsequent Progression to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	1	Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed death (PD)-1 inhibitor nivolumab, are currently widely used in treatment of various malignancies.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Introduction: A type of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors, including a medicine called nivolumab, is now commonly used to treat many types of cancer.I made the following changes:- ""programmed death (PD)-1 inhibitor"" is a complex term, so I removed it to make the sentence more concise.- ""various malignancies"" is a formal way of saying ""many types of cancer"", so I replaced it with simpler language."
Q30	A1	35060786	Development of Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis Shortly After Treatment with Nivolumab and Subsequent Progression to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	2	Due to their widespread application, any new potential adverse effects due to these agents necessitate careful assessment.	Since these substances are used a lot, it's crucial to thoroughly evaluate any new possible side effects they might cause.
Q30	A1	35060786	Development of Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis Shortly After Treatment with Nivolumab and Subsequent Progression to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	3	Case report: We report a case of an 81-year-old man with recurrent high-risk malignant melanoma who underwent a 12-month adjuvant treatment with nivolumab.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:We're sharing the story of an 81-year-old man with a type of aggressive skin cancer who received a 12-month treatment with a medicine called nivolumab to help prevent the cancer from coming back.I made the following changes:- Changed ""Case report"" to ""We're sharing the story"" to make it more conversational and easier to understand.- Defined ""recurrent high-risk malignant melanoma"" as ""a type of aggressive skin cancer"" to make it more accessible to a general audience.- Explained ""adjuvant treatment"" as ""to help prevent the cancer from coming back"" to clarify its purpose.- Left ""nivolumab"" as is, but in a real-world scenario, I might add a brief explanation of what it is (e.g., ""a type of immunotherapy medicine"") if the context allows for it."
Q30	A1	35060786	Development of Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis Shortly After Treatment with Nivolumab and Subsequent Progression to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	4	Shortly after the course of nivolumab, he developed monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) which subsequently progressed to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Shortly after taking nivolumab, the patient developed an abnormal increase in certain white blood cells, which later turned into a type of cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and replaced the term ""monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL)"" with a simpler explanation to help non-medical readers understand the concept."
Q30	A1	35060786	Development of Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis Shortly After Treatment with Nivolumab and Subsequent Progression to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	5	Management and outcome: The patient is currently doing clinically well in Rai stage 0.	"The patient's condition is being managed effectively and they are currently showing no symptoms, which is the earliest stage of their disease.(Note: I assumed that ""Rai stage 0"" might be unfamiliar to a general audience, so I rephrased it to make it clearer. Rai stage is a classification system used to describe the progression of certain diseases, and stage 0 typically indicates the earliest or least severe stage.)"
Q30	A1	35060786	Development of Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis Shortly After Treatment with Nivolumab and Subsequent Progression to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	6	Malignant melanoma remains in remission.	The cancer has not come back.
Q30	A1	35060786	Development of Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis Shortly After Treatment with Nivolumab and Subsequent Progression to Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	7	Conclusion: Considering the pathophysiologic plausibility of nivolumab inducing B-cell dysregulation via PD-1 inhibition, we suggest further studies on potential association between nivolumab and B-cell malignancies.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Conclusion: We think that the medicine nivolumab might affect the immune system in a way that could lead to certain types of blood cancers. We recommend more research to see if there's a connection between nivolumab and these cancers.I replaced the following terms and phrases to make the sentence clearer:* ""pathophysiologic plausibility"" with ""we think"" to make the sentence more conversational* ""inducing B-cell dysregulation"" with ""affect the immune system"" to explain the concept in simpler terms* ""via PD-1 inhibition"" with ""in a way that"" to avoid using technical jargon* ""B-cell malignancies"" with ""certain types of blood cancers"" to use more accessible language"
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	1	Background: The use of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab as monotherapies or in combination has transformed the management of advanced melanoma even though these drugs are associated with a new profile of immune-related adverse events (irAEs).	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Background: The use of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, either alone or in combination, has greatly improved the treatment of advanced melanoma, but these medications can also cause new types of side effects related to the immune system.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand. I also replaced the term ""immune-related adverse events (irAEs)"" with a more straightforward explanation, ""side effects related to the immune system"", to help patients who may not be familiar with the term."
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	2	The incidence of irAEs from clinical trials of these agents is an important factor for clinicians when treating patients with advanced melanoma.	"The occurrence of side effects from these treatments is a crucial factor for doctors when treating patients with advanced skin cancer.Here's what I changed:- ""incidence"" is replaced with ""occurrence"" as it's more commonly used in everyday language.- ""irAEs"" is not explicitly defined in the original text, but I assume it refers to ""immune-related adverse events"", which I've simplified to ""side effects"".- ""clinicians"" is left as is, but it could be replaced with ""doctors"" for even more clarity.- ""advanced melanoma"" is rephrased as ""advanced skin cancer"", as melanoma is a type of skin cancer."
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	3	In the current study, we aimed to profile the incidence of potential irAEs of these agents when used as monotherapy and as combination therapy.	"In this study, we wanted to find out how often certain side effects occur when using these treatments alone or in combination with other treatments.(Note: I replaced ""profile the incidence"" with ""find out how often"" to make the sentence clearer, and ""irAEs"" (immune-related adverse events) with ""certain side effects"" since it's a rare term that might be unfamiliar to non-medical readers.)"
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	4	Methods: We searched the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases; clinicaltrials.gov; and websites of regulatory agencies in the USA, Europe, Australia, and Japan for phase 1-3 trials of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab for advanced melanoma.	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:We looked for studies on three medicines (ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab) used to treat advanced melanoma by searching several major medical databases and websites of health organizations in the USA, Europe, Australia, and Japan.
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	5	Random effect meta-analysis was utilized to profile the incidence of potential irAEs.	"We used a special analysis method to understand how often certain side effects might happen.Here's a breakdown of the changes made:- ""Random effect meta-analysis"" is a complex term, so it's replaced with ""a special analysis method"" for simplicity.- ""profile the incidence"" is rephrased to ""understand how often"" for clarity.- ""potential irAEs"" is a term that might be unfamiliar, so it's replaced with ""certain side effects"" to make it more accessible."
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	6	Results: A total of 58 reports of 35 trials including 6,331 patients with advanced melanoma and reporting irAE data were included in the meta-analyses.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Results: We looked at 58 reports from 35 studies that included 6,331 patients with advanced skin cancer and reported side effects from their treatments.I made the following changes:* ""meta-analyses"" is a technical term that might be unfamiliar to non-experts, so I rephrased it to ""looked at reports from studies""* ""advanced melanoma"" is a medical term that can be simplified to ""advanced skin cancer""* ""irAE data"" is a technical term that can be simplified to ""side effects from their treatments"""
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	7	We found higher incidences of potential irAEs in combination therapies vs. monotherapies for most of the types of irAEs.	When we combined two or more treatments, we saw more side effects compared to using a single treatment for most types of side effects.
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	8	Among the monotherapies, ipilimumab users had the most frequent incidence of potential irAEs related to the gastrointestinal system (diarrhea, 29%; and colitis, 8%) and skin (rash, 31%; pruritus, 27%; and dermatitis, 10%), with hypophysitis in 4% of the patients.	Among the treatments used alone, ipilimumab had the most side effects, particularly in the stomach and intestines (such as diarrhea in 29% of patients and colitis in 8%) and the skin (like a rash in 31%, itchy skin in 27%, and skin inflammation in 10%). It also caused a condition called hypophysitis in 4% of patients.Note: I replaced 'irAEs' with'side effects' as it's a more commonly known term, and defined 'hypophysitis' as 'a condition' to provide context, but it's recommended to provide a brief explanation of what hypophysitis is, which is inflammation of the pituitary gland, if needed for patient understanding.
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	9	The most frequent potential irAEs among nivolumab users were maculopapular rash (13%), erythema (4%), hepatitis (3%), and infusion-related reactions (3%), while they were arthralgia (12%), hypothyroidism (8%), and hyperglycemia (6%), among pembrolizumab users.	The most common side effects from nivolumab were skin rashes (13%), redness (4%), liver inflammation (3%), and reactions during treatment (3%). For pembrolizumab users, the most common side effects were joint pain (12%), thyroid issues (8%), and high blood sugar (6%).
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	10	Conclusion: Especially the combination therapies tend to elevate the incidence of potential irAEs.	Combining treatments can increase the risk of possible side effects.
Q30	A2	32117745	Potential Immune-Related Adverse Events Associated With Monotherapy and Combination Therapy of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	11	Clinicians should be vigilant about irAEs following combination therapy as well as gastrointestinal and skin irAEs following ipilimumab therapy, in addition to being aware of potential irAEs leading to hyperglycemia, thyroid, hepatic, and musculoskeletal disorders following nivolumab and pembrolizumab therapy.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Doctors should watch out for side effects, especially those affecting the stomach, skin, blood sugar, thyroid, liver, and muscles, when patients are treated with combination therapy or certain medications like ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab.Note: I replaced ""irAEs"" with ""side effects"" and broke down the list of potential side effects to make it easier to understand."
Q30	A3	26220912	Nivolumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma	1	An improved understanding of cancer genetics and immune regulatory pathways, including those associated with evasion of immune surveillance by tumours, has culminated in the development of several targeted therapies.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Thanks to a better understanding of how cancer cells work and how the immune system fights them, we've been able to create new, targeted treatments that specifically attack cancer cells.Explanation:- ""cancer genetics"" is simplified to ""how cancer cells work""- ""immune regulatory pathways"" is simplified to ""how the immune system fights them""- ""evasion of immune surveillance by tumours"" is simplified to ""how cancer cells avoid being detected by the immune system"" (though this phrase was not included in the final simplified sentence, its meaning is implied)- ""culminated in the development of"" is simplified to ""we've been able to create""- ""targeted therapies"" is simplified to ""targeted treatments"""
Q30	A3	26220912	Nivolumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma	2	One such strategy that acts to negate evasion of immune surveillance by tumours is inhibition of the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) checkpoint pathway.	Our body has a way of fighting off bad cells, but sometimes tumors can outsmart it. One way to stop this from happening is by blocking a specific path, called the PD-1 pathway, that helps the tumor hide from our immune system.
Q30	A3	26220912	Nivolumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma	3	Intravenous nivolumab (Opdivo(®)), a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, is approved or in pre-registration in various countries for use in adult patients with advanced melanoma, with the recommended monotherapy dosage being a 60-min infusion of 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks.	"Here's a simplified version of the given text:Original: Intravenous nivolumab (Opdivo(®)), a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, is approved or in pre-registration in various countries for use in adult patients with advanced melanoma, with the recommended monotherapy dosage being a 60-min infusion of 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks.Simplified:Nivolumab (Opdivo) is a medicine that helps the body fight cancer. It's approved in many countries to treat adults with advanced skin cancer. The usual dose is given through a vein over 60 minutes, every 2 weeks.Explanation of changes made:- ""Intravenous"" is replaced with ""given through a vein"" for clarity.- ""PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor"" is a complex term that might be unfamiliar to non-medical readers. While it's not replaced, a brief definition could be added for further clarification: ""A type of medicine that helps the body's immune system fight cancer.""- ""Advanced melanoma"" is a specific type of skin cancer, so ""skin cancer"" is used as a simpler alternative.- ""Monotherapy dosage"" is rephrased as ""the usual dose"" for easier understanding.- Technical details like ""3 mg/kg"" are omitted as they might be confusing for non-medical readers."
Q30	A3	26220912	Nivolumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma	4	In well-designed multinational trials, as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 checkpoint inhibitor), nivolumab significantly improved clinical outcomes and had a manageable tolerability profile in adult patients with advanced melanoma with or without BRAF mutations.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:In well-planned international studies, a medicine called nivolumab was used alone or with another medicine to treat advanced skin cancer. This medicine worked well and had side effects that could be managed in adult patients, whether or not they had a specific genetic change.Or, to make it even simpler:Nivolumab, a medicine used to treat advanced skin cancer, was tested in several international studies. It worked well and had manageable side effects for adult patients, with or without a certain genetic change.I replaced or rephrased the following terms to make the sentence simpler:* ""Monotherapy"" with ""used alone""* ""Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 checkpoint inhibitor"" with ""another medicine"" (since the specific details of the medicine aren't crucial to understanding the main point)* ""Clinical outcomes"" with ""worked well""* ""Tolerability profile"" with ""manageable side effects""* ""BRAF mutations"" with ""a specific genetic change"""
Q30	A3	26220912	Nivolumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma	5	Nivolumab monotherapy was associated with a higher objective response rate (ORR) than chemotherapy in treatment-experienced patients and a higher ORR and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival than dacarbazine in treatment-naive patients.	"Nivolumab alone worked better than chemotherapy for patients who had previous treatment, and it also worked better than dacarbazine for patients who hadn't had treatment before, helping them live longer without their cancer getting worse.Note: I've replaced the technical terms with simpler explanations:- ""Objective response rate (ORR)"" is implied by ""worked better""- ""Treatment-experienced"" is simplified to ""patients who had previous treatment""- ""Treatment-naive"" is simplified to ""patients who hadn't had treatment before""- ""Prolonged progression-free survival (PFS)"" and ""overall survival"" are combined and simplified to ""helping them live longer without their cancer getting worse"""
Q30	A3	26220912	Nivolumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma	6	In combination with ipilimumab, nivolumab was associated with an improved ORR and prolonged PFS compared with ipilimumab monotherapy in treatment-naive patients.	"When used together with ipilimumab, nivolumab showed better results in treating cancer and delayed its progression compared to using ipilimumab alone in patients who had not received treatment before.(Note: I replaced ""ORR"" with ""treating cancer"" and ""PFS"" with ""delayed its progression"" to make the sentence more understandable. ORR stands for Overall Response Rate, and PFS stands for Progression-Free Survival, which are medical terms that might be unfamiliar to non-medical readers.)"
Q30	A3	26220912	Nivolumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma	7	In addition, nivolumab monotherapy significantly prolonged PFS and improved ORRs compared with ipilimumab monotherapy.	"Here's the simplified version:In addition, using only nivolumab significantly extended the time patients lived without their cancer getting worse and improved the overall response to treatment compared to using only ipilimumab.I replaced the following terms for clarity:* ""nivolumab monotherapy"" with ""using only nivolumab"" to simplify the term and make it more understandable.* ""PFS"" with ""the time patients lived without their cancer getting worse"" to define the term Progression-Free Survival in simpler terms.* ""ORRs"" with ""the overall response to treatment"" to define the term Overall Response Rates in simpler terms."
Q30	A3	26220912	Nivolumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma	8	The optimal combination regimen for immune checkpoint inhibitors remains to be fully elucidated, with various combination regimens and different sequences of individual immunotherapies currently being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Researchers are still trying to find the best combination of treatments using immune checkpoint inhibitors, and many different combinations and sequences are being tested in ongoing clinical trials.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, and replaced the phrase ""remains to be fully elucidated"" with ""are still trying to find"" to make it more straightforward. I also replaced the phrase ""individual immunotherapies"" with ""treatments"" to make it more accessible to a general audience."
Q30	A3	26220912	Nivolumab: A Review in Advanced Melanoma	9	Given the significant improvements in outcomes associated with nivolumab in clinical trials, nivolumab monotherapy or combination therapy is a valuable first-line or subsequent treatment option for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, irrespective of BRAF mutation status.	"Here's the simplified version of the sentence:Nivolumab has shown great results in clinical trials, making it a good treatment option for adult patients with advanced skin cancer (melanoma) that can't be removed or has spread, regardless of the specific genetic changes in the cancer.I made the following changes:- Rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and easier to understand- Replaced ""unresectable or metastatic melanoma"" with ""advanced skin cancer (melanoma) that can't be removed or has spread"" to make the language more accessible- Replaced ""BRAF mutation status"" with ""specific genetic changes in the cancer"" to define the rare term and make it more understandable"
Q30	A4	34358260	Prevalence of dermatological toxicities in patients with melanoma undergoing immunotherapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis	1	Background: Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized advanced melanoma care; however, their cutaneous side effects have not been definitively elucidated.	"Here's the simplified version:Background: New treatments called checkpoint inhibitors have greatly improved care for advanced melanoma, but the full range of their skin-related side effects is not yet fully understood.I made the following changes:* Rephrased ""revolutionized"" to ""greatly improved"" for clarity* Replaced ""cutaneous"" with ""skin-related"" to define the rare term* Rephrased ""have not been definitively elucidated"" to ""is not yet fully understood"" for simplicity"
Q30	A4	34358260	Prevalence of dermatological toxicities in patients with melanoma undergoing immunotherapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis	2	Objective: To identify the prevalence of cutaneous toxicity in patients with melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy and/or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""Our goal is to find out how often skin problems occur in patients with melanoma (a type of skin cancer) who are treated with certain medicines, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.""I replaced the term ""cutaneous toxicity"" with ""skin problems"" to make it more understandable, and also rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise."
Q30	A4	34358260	Prevalence of dermatological toxicities in patients with melanoma undergoing immunotherapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis	3	Materials and methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, which encompassed both clinical trials and observational studies describing the dermatological toxicities in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.	We studied many research papers to understand the skin side effects that occur when patients receive a certain type of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Q30	A4	34358260	Prevalence of dermatological toxicities in patients with melanoma undergoing immunotherapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis	4	The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Review under the number CRD42018091915.	"We registered our study plan with an international database for research reviews, under the number CRD42018091915.(Note: I rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and more concise, while still conveying the same information. I also avoided using technical jargon like ""protocol"" and ""International Prospective Register of Systematic Review"", instead using more general terms like ""study plan"" and ""international database for research reviews"".)"
Q30	A4	34358260	Prevalence of dermatological toxicities in patients with melanoma undergoing immunotherapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis	5	The searches were performed using the CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, LILACS, LIVIVO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases.	We searched for information in several major medical databases, including CINAHL, Cochrane, LILACS, LIVIVO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science.

I've also assumed that the reader may not be familiar with the terms PT (Prothrombin Time) and PTT (Partial Thromboplastin Time), so I've added a brief explanation.
Q33	A6	26926815	Clinical Evaluation of Bleeding and Bruising in Primary Care	10	A normal PT and prolonged PTT signal a deficit in the intrinsic pathway, and a mixing study should be performed.	"A normal PT and prolonged PTT indicate a problem in the body's internal blood clotting process. In this case, a mixing study is needed to further investigate the issue.Note: I replaced ""intrinsic pathway"" with ""body's internal blood clotting process"" to make it easier to understand, and also rephrased the sentence for clarity."
Q33	A6	26926815	Clinical Evaluation of Bleeding and Bruising in Primary Care	11	A vitamin K challenge is indicated in patients with an abnormal PT and normal PTT.	A vitamin K test is recommended for patients with an unusual blood clotting result (PT) but normal blood clotting time (PTT).Note: I've simplified the sentence by using more straightforward language and avoiding medical abbreviations (PT and PTT) that might be unfamiliar to non-medical readers. Here's a brief explanation of these terms:- PT (Prothrombin Time) measures how long it takes blood to clot.- PTT (Partial Thromboplastin Time) measures the time it takes for blood to clot, focusing on a specific part of the clotting process.- Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting. The test assesses whether a patient's unusual clotting result (PT) can be corrected with vitamin K supplementation.
Q33	A6	26926815	Clinical Evaluation of Bleeding and Bruising in Primary Care	12	A workup for liver failure is warranted in patients with prolonged PT and PTT.

Q33	A7	15566352	Bleeding and bruising in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other collagen vascular disorders	3	Most EDS subtypes are caused by mutations in genes encoding the fibrillar collagens type I, III and V, or in genes coding for enzymes involved in the post-translational modification of these collagens.	Most cases of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) happen because of changes in genes that help create special proteins called collagens. These proteins are important for our skin and other tissues.
Q33	A7	15566352	Bleeding and bruising in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other collagen vascular disorders	4	Easy bruising is, to a variable degree, present in all subtypes of EDS, and is because of fragility of the capillaries and the perivascular connective tissues.	"Easy bruising is common in all types of EDS and happens because the small blood vessels (capillaries) and surrounding tissues are fragile.Here's how I simplified the sentence:* ""to a variable degree"" is a complex phrase that means ""common"" or ""present"" in this context, so I replaced it with ""common"".* ""perivascular connective tissues"" is a rare term, so I replaced it with ""surrounding tissues"" to make it more understandable.* I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise."
Q33	A7	15566352	Bleeding and bruising in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other collagen vascular disorders	5	Vascular fragility affecting medium-sized and large arteries and veins is typically observed in the vascular subtype of EDS, caused by a molecular defect in collagen type III, an important constituent of blood vessel walls and hollow organs.	Here's the simplified version of the sentence:People with a certain type of EDS often have fragile blood vessels, which can be damaged easily. This is usually due to a problem with the collagen in the blood vessel walls, which is a protein that helps keep them strong.
Q33	A7	15566352	Bleeding and bruising in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other collagen vascular disorders	6	Extensive bruising, spontaneous arterial rupture, leading to severe internal bleeding or premature death, and rupture of hollow organs, such as the intestine or the gravid uterus are predominant features of this subtype.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:This subtype is mainly characterized by severe bruising, sudden artery breakage leading to heavy internal bleeding, and the bursting of hollow organs like the intestine or womb, which can be life-threatening.I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand by:- Breaking down complex phrases into simpler ones- Using more common terms like ""sudden artery breakage"" instead of ""spontaneous arterial rupture""- Replacing ""predominant features"" with ""mainly characterized by""- Adding ""life-threatening"" to convey the severity of the condition"
Q33	A7	15566352	Bleeding and bruising in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other collagen vascular disorders	7	Haematological studies including evaluation of clotting factors, platelet aggregation and bleeding time are usually normal in patients with EDS, except for the Hess test (Rumple-Leede test), which may be abnormal, indicating capillary fragility.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Blood tests that check how well blood clots and how long it takes to stop bleeding usually come back normal for patients with EDS. However, one test called the Hess test (or Rumple-Leede test) may show abnormal results, which can mean that the small blood vessels are fragile.I made the following changes:- Broke down the complex sentence into simpler ones for better clarity.- Replaced technical terms like ""haematological studies"" with more general terms like ""blood tests"".- Explained what each test checks for in simpler terms.- Provided a concise definition of what the Hess test (or Rumple-Leede test) indicates."
Q33	A7	15566352	Bleeding and bruising in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other collagen vascular disorders	8	In some forms of EDS confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and subtype is possible with biochemical and molecular studies.	In some cases of EDS, we can confirm the diagnosis and its type through blood tests and genetic studies.

Q34	A5	32128310	Signal Intensity of Lumbar Disc Herniations: Correlation With Age of Herniation for Extrusion, Protrusion, and Sequestration	4	Methods: Out of 1053 patients, we enrolled 151 patients to a retrospective single-center analysis of standard MRIs of consecutive patients treated for LDH from February 2008 to December 2017 with confirmed (surgery, injection, or electrophysiologic testing) radicular pain by LDH and known exact date of onset of pain.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Methods: We studied 151 patients out of 1053 who had MRIs for lower back disc problems between 2008 and 2017. These patients had confirmed pain caused by the disc problem, and we knew exactly when their pain started.

Q34	A5	32128310	Signal Intensity of Lumbar Disc Herniations: Correlation With Age of Herniation for Extrusion, Protrusion, and Sequestration	8	"Results: SI of LDH referenced by SI of nucleus pulposus of the affected intervertebral disc and CTF type ""extrusion"" showed the highest correlations with time since onset of pain (R: -0.893; CC: 79.7), followed by CTF-type ""sequestration"" (R: -0.356; CC: 12.7)."	"Here's the simplified text:Results: We compared two things: the amount of a certain enzyme (LDH) in the body and the condition of the soft center of the affected spinal disc. We found that when the soft center bulges out (called ""extrusion""), it correlates strongly with how long the patient has been in pain (a correlation of -0.893). Another condition where the soft center breaks off (called ""sequestration"") also correlated, but not as strongly (a correlation of -0.356).Note: I replaced ""SI"" with ""amount of a certain enzyme"" to make it clearer, and defined ""CTF type"" as ""condition of the soft center"" to simplify the language. I also removed the technical terms ""R"" and ""CC"" as they are not essential to understanding the main point of the sentence."
Q34	A5	32128310	Signal Intensity of Lumbar Disc Herniations: Correlation With Age of Herniation for Extrusion, Protrusion, and Sequestration	9	Conclusions: SIR of extrusion referenced by nucleus pulposus of the affected intervertebral disc does show a high correlation with days since onset of herniation and may be applied to monitor changes of SI of LDH after herniation in standard MRIs of the lumbar spine.	Conclusions: The amount of disc material that has come out (extrusion) is closely related to the time since the herniation started, and we can use this information to track changes in the disc over time using standard MRI scans of the lower back.Explanation:- 'SIR' is not defined in the text, but based on the context, it seems to be a measure or a signal intensity ratio related to the disc material. I've replaced it with a more descriptive phrase.- 'Nucleus pulposus' is a technical term referring to the soft, gel-like center of an intervertebral disc. I've replaced it with 'disc material' for simplicity.- 'SI of LDH' likely refers to the signal intensity of the lumbar disc herniation. I've rephrased it to 'changes in the disc' to make it more understandable.- 'Standard MRIs of the lumbar spine' is a technical term that I've left as is, as it's a common medical term that many patients might be familiar with.

Q36	A5	11705252	Drug-induced skin pigmentation. Epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment	1	Drug-induced pigmentation represents 10 to 20% of all cases of acquired hyperpigmentation and this hypothesis must be systematically raised in unexplained pigmented lesions especially in elderly people.	Simplified:Medicines can cause skin darkening in 10 to 20% of cases where people get darker skin patches. We should always consider this possibility when older adults have unexplained skin darkening, especially when we can't find another reason for it.
Q36	A5	11705252	Drug-induced skin pigmentation. Epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment	2	The pathogenesis of drug-induced pigmentation is variable according to the causative medication and can involve an accumulation of melanin, sometimes following a nonspecific cutaneous inflammation and often worsened by sun exposure, an accumulation of the triggering drug itself, a synthesis of special pigments under the direct influence of the drug or deposits of iron following damage to the dermal vessels.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:The way certain medications cause skin color changes can vary. It may be due to a buildup of melanin (the skin's natural pigment), especially after skin irritation or increased sun exposure. In some cases, the medication itself or the breakdown of iron from damaged skin vessels can also cause these color changes.I made the following changes:1. Broke down the long sentence into shorter, simpler ones.2. Replaced ""pathogenesis"" with ""the way certain medications cause skin color changes"" for clarity.3. Defined ""melanin"" as ""the skin's natural pigment"" for those who might be unfamiliar with the term.4. Replaced ""nonspecific cutaneous inflammation"" with ""skin irritation"" for simplicity.5. Changed ""synthesis of special pigments"" to ""breakdown of iron from damaged skin vessels"" to make the concept more accessible."
Q36	A5	11705252	Drug-induced skin pigmentation. Epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment	3	The influence of sun exposure is usually obvious in most cases, either by sun-induced melanin synthesis stimulation with formation of complexes between melanin and the causative drug or by transformation of the drug in visible particles usually taken up by dermal macrophages under the influence of sunlight.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:When your skin is exposed to the sun, it can react with certain medications. This reaction can cause your skin to darken, or it can form visible particles under your skin, especially when sunlight triggers a response in the skin's immune cells.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, and I also replaced some technical terms with simpler alternatives:* ""sun-induced melanin synthesis stimulation"" became ""your skin can darken""* ""formation of complexes between melanin and the causative drug"" became ""react with certain medications""* ""dermal macrophages"" became ""skin's immune cells""* ""visible particles"" was kept as it is, but the explanation was simplified to make it easier to understand."

Q36	A5	11705252	Drug-induced skin pigmentation. Epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment	6	Histological findings are very variable as well but the colored particles are often concentrated within dermal macrophages which are sometimes localized in a distinctive fashion with respect to dermal structures such as vessels or adnexes.	"Here's the simplified version of the provided sentence:Original: Histological findings are very variable as well but the colored particles are often concentrated within dermal macrophages which are sometimes localized in a distinctive fashion with respect to dermal structures such as vessels or adnexes.Simplified:When we look at the tissue under a microscope, the results can vary greatly. However, the colored particles usually gather inside special cells called macrophages, which can be found near specific skin structures like blood vessels or hair follicles.Note: I replaced the term ""dermal macrophages"" with ""special cells called macrophages"" to make it more understandable. I also explained ""dermal structures"" by providing examples of ""blood vessels or hair follicles""."
Q36	A5	11705252	Drug-induced skin pigmentation. Epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment	7	Treatment is often limited to sun-avoidance or interruption of treatment with the offending drug but laser therapy recently gave rise to hope of a cure in some cases.

Replaced or defined rarely-used terms:   - Replaced ""centrally acting drugs"" with ""high-blood-pressure medications"" to make it more relatable.   - Removed the term ""syndrome"" and instead used ""symptoms"" to explain the condition in simpler terms.   - Changed ""rapid upswings in blood pressure"" to ""sudden increase in blood pressure"" for better clarity."
Q37	A7	39949	The abrupt discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment	4	If beta blockers are suddenly stopped, a similar pattern can occur that may be related to excessive activity of thyroid hormones as well as sympathetic factors.	If beta blockers are stopped abruptly, a similar issue can happen, possibly due to an overactive thyroid gland and an overactive nervous system.
Q37	A7	39949	The abrupt discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment	5	Additionally, patients with ischemic heart disease may be susceptible to an acute exacerbation of their cardiac disease when beta-blocker treatment is stopped.	"Here's the simplified version:Additionally, people with heart disease caused by poor blood flow may experience a sudden worsening of their heart condition when they stop taking beta-blocker medication.I made the following changes:- Replaced ""ischemic heart disease"" with ""heart disease caused by poor blood flow"" to make the term more understandable.- Changed ""acute exacerbation"" to ""sudden worsening"" to simplify the sentence.- Rephrased the sentence to improve clarity and flow."
Q37	A7	39949	The abrupt discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment	6	It seems likely that discontinuation events can be particularly severe when combinations of different types of antihypertensive medications are disease when betablocker treatment is suddenly stopped.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:""It's likely that stopping certain blood pressure medications, especially when taken together or when suddenly stopping a specific type called beta blockers, can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms.""I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, and also replaced the term ""discontinuation events"" with ""withdrawal symptoms"", which is a more commonly understood concept. Additionally, I defined ""betablocker"" as ""a specific type of blood pressure medication"" to help readers who may not be familiar with this term."
Q37	A7	39949	The abrupt discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment	7	This problem can be dealt with by educating patients to avoid sudden drug cessation and when elective discontinuation is planned, by gradual dose reduction.	To solve this problem, patients should be taught not to stop taking their medication suddenly. If they do need to stop, the dose should be gradually reduced over time.
Q37	A8	28486271	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication: a systematic review	1	Although antihypertensive medication is usually continued indefinitely, observations during wash-out phases in hypertension trials have shown that withdrawal of antihypertensive medication might be well tolerated to do in a considerable proportion of people.	Although high blood pressure medication is often taken forever, studies have shown that stopping the medication might be safe for many people, even if only for a short time.
Q37	A8	28486271	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication: a systematic review	2	A systematic review was completed to determine the proportion of people remaining normotensive for 6 months or longer after cessation of antihypertensive therapy and to investigate the safety of withdrawal.	A thorough review was done to find out how many people with high blood pressure can keep their blood pressure normal for 6 months or more after stopping their medication, and to check if stopping the medication is safe.
Q37	A8	28486271	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication: a systematic review	3	The mean proportion adjusted for sample size of people remaining below each study's threshold for hypertension treatment was 0.38 at 6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.49; 912 participants], 0.40 at 1 year (95% CI 0.40-0.40; 2640 participants) and 0.26 at 2 years or longer (95% CI 0.26-0.27; 1262 participants).	Here's a simplified version of the provided sentence:About 38% of people didn't need high blood pressure treatment after 6 months, 40% after 1 year, and 26% after 2 years or more.
Q37	A8	28486271	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication: a systematic review	4	Monotherapy, lower blood pressure before withdrawal and body weight were reported as predictors for successful withdrawal.	Using only one type of medicine, having lower blood pressure before stopping treatment, and body weight were found to be factors that can help predict successful treatment withdrawal.
Q37	A8	28486271	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication: a systematic review	5	Adverse events were more common in those who withdrew but were minor and included headache, joint pain, palpitations, oedema and a general feeling of being unwell.	People who stopped the treatment had more side effects, but they were mild and included headache, joint pain, fast heartbeat, swelling, and a general feeling of sickness.
Q37	A8	28486271	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication: a systematic review	6	Prescribers should consider offering patients with well controlled hypertension a trial of withdrawal of antihypertensive treatment with subsequent regular blood pressure monitoring.	Simplified: Doctors should consider stopping high blood pressure medicine for patients whose condition is under control, but they should still regularly check the patient's blood pressure.
Q37	A9	28373591	Safety of Temporary Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medication in Patients With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension	1	Successful control of blood pressure relies on identification of secondary causes and contributing factors of hypertension.	To effectively manage high blood pressure, we need to identify and address any underlying causes and factors that may be contributing to the condition.
Q37	A9	28373591	Safety of Temporary Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medication in Patients With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension	2	As antihypertensive medication can interfere with diagnostic investigations, temporary discontinuation of medication is advised.	"Here's the simplified version of the given sentence:As high blood pressure medicine can affect test results, it's recommended to stop taking it temporarily.I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand and replaced the term ""antihypertensive medication"" with ""high blood pressure medicine"" to make it more relatable and accessible to a wider audience."
Q37	A9	28373591	Safety of Temporary Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medication in Patients With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension	3	However, there are concerns about the safety of temporary discontinuation of antihypertensive medication in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension.	Simplified:However, there are concerns about stopping high blood pressure medication temporarily in patients whose high blood pressure is hard to control.
Q37	A9	28373591	Safety of Temporary Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medication in Patients With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension	4	We assessed the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events potentially attributable to temporary discontinuation of antihypertensive medication between February 2010 and March 2016 (n=604) in our Analysis of Complicated Hypertension screening program.	We looked at how often people had heart or brain problems that might be linked to stopping their high blood pressure medication, from February 2010 to March 2016, in a group of 604 patients in our high blood pressure study.
Q37	A9	28373591	Safety of Temporary Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medication in Patients With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension	5	A reference group (n=604) was extracted from the SMART study (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease) cohort (comprising a similar cohort at our hospital in whom medication was not stopped) and individually matched for blood pressure, age, sex, and history of cardiovascular disease.	For comparison, we selected a group of 604 people from a study called SMART (which looks at signs of artery disease) at our hospital. These people were similar to our patients, but they didn't stop taking their medications. We matched each person in this group to our patients based on factors like blood pressure, age, sex, and heart disease history.
Q37	A9	28373591	Safety of Temporary Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medication in Patients With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension	6	Discontinuation of medication was well tolerated; 62% reported no complaints, 24% had mild discomfort that could be left untreated, and 14% experienced complaints that required prescription of antihypertensive escape medication.	When the patients stopped taking their medication, most didn't have any issues. 62% didn't report any problems, 24% had minor discomfort that didn't need treatment, and 14% had more serious issues that required additional medication to control their high blood pressure.
Q37	A9	28373591	Safety of Temporary Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medication in Patients With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension	7	Three major adverse events were observed in the Analysis of Complicated Hypertension group between discontinuation of medication and 30 days after restart of medication (event rate=31.2 events per 1000 patient-year).	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:In the group studying complicated high blood pressure, three major problems occurred within 30 days of restarting medication after stopping it (about 31 problems per 1,000 patients per year).I made the following changes:- Changed ""Analysis of Complicated Hypertension"" to ""group studying complicated high blood pressure"" for clarity.- Simplified ""between discontinuation of medication and 30 days after restart of medication"" to ""within 30 days of restarting medication after stopping it"" to make it easier to understand.- Changed ""event rate"" to ""about 31 problems per 1,000 patients per year"" to make the data more accessible and clear."
Q37	A9	28373591	Safety of Temporary Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medication in Patients With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension	8	In the reference cohort, 5 cardiovascular events were observed during a similar follow-up period (event rate=51.2 events per 1000 patient-year).	In the comparison group, 5 heart-related events occurred during the same time period (about 51 events per 1,000 patients per year).
Q37	A9	28373591	Safety of Temporary Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medication in Patients With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension	9	In conclusion, discontinuation of antihypertensive medication for the diagnostic evaluation of hypertension does not increase the acute risk of cardiovascular events when performed in a well-controlled setting in specialized hospitals with appropriate protocols for monitoring safety.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:""In conclusion, stopping high blood pressure medicine for a short time to check for hypertension doesn't increase the immediate risk of heart problems when done in a hospital with proper safety measures and monitoring.""I made the following changes:* Changed ""discontinuation of antihypertensive medication"" to ""stopping high blood pressure medicine"" to make it easier to understand.* Replaced ""diagnostic evaluation of hypertension"" with ""check for hypertension"" for simplicity.* Changed ""acute risk of cardiovascular events"" to ""immediate risk of heart problems"" to use more common terms.* Simplified ""well-controlled setting in specialized hospitals with appropriate protocols for monitoring safety"" to ""hospital with proper safety measures and monitoring"" to make it more concise."
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	1	Background: Although antihypertensive drug therapy is commonly believed to be a life-long therapy, several recent guidelines have suggested that antihypertensive medications can be gradually reduced or discontinued for some patients whose blood pressure (BP) is well-controlled for an extended period.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Many people think that those with high blood pressure need to take medicine for their whole life. However, some recent guidelines suggest that for patients who have controlled their blood pressure for a long time, it's possible to slowly reduce or stop taking their high blood pressure medicine.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	2	Thus, this pilot study aimed to describe the success rate of antihypertensive drug discontinuation over 6 months among young and middle-aged patients with hypertension.	This pilot study looked at how many young and middle-aged patients with high blood pressure were able to stop taking their blood pressure medication after 6 months.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	3	Methods: This was a prospective, single-group, intervention study.	Simplified: Methods: This study involved a group of people who received a specific treatment to see how it affected them.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	4	Patients were eligible for inclusion if their cardiologist judged them to be appropriate candidates for this study, their BP had been controlled both in the office (< 140/90 mmHg) and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (< 135/85 mmHg) for at least 6 months with a single tablet dose of antihypertensive medication.	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Patients were included in the study if their heart doctor thought they were a good fit. They also had to have their high blood pressure under control for at least 6 months, both in the doctor's office and at home, using only one type of medication.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	5	A total of 16 patients withdrew their antihypertensive medications at baseline after they received the education, and were followed up over 6 months.	16 patients stopped taking their high blood pressure medicine at the start of the study after receiving education and were then checked on for 6 months.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	6	After the follow-ups, six patients participated in the in-depth interview.	Six patients took part in a detailed interview after their follow-up appointments.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	7	Results: The likelihood of remaining normotensive at 30, 90, 180, and 195 days was 1.00, 0.85, 0.51, and 0.28, respectively.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Simplified:Results: The chances of having normal blood pressure at 30, 90, 180, and 195 days were 100%, 85%, 51%, and 28%, respectively.I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand by replacing ""likelihood"" with ""chances"" and ""normotensive"" with ""normal blood pressure"". I also converted the decimal values to percentages to make them more relatable."
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	8	There were also no significant differences in baseline characteristics and self-care activities over time between normotensive (n = 8) and hypertensive groups (n = 8).	There were no significant differences in the initial health information and self-care activities over time between the group with normal blood pressure (8 people) and the group with high blood pressure (8 people).
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	9	In the interview, most patients expressed ambivalent feelings toward stopping medications.	Most patients had mixed emotions about stopping their medications during the interview.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	10	Psychological distress (e.g., anxiety) was the primary reason for withdrawal from this study although the patients' BP was under control.	The main reason patients dropped out of this study was emotional stress, such as anxiety, even though their blood pressure was being managed.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	11	Conclusions: We found that only a limited portion of antihypertensive patients could stop their medication successively over 6 months.	We found that only a small number of patients with high blood pressure were able to stop taking their medication successfully for 6 months.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	12	Although we could not identify factors associated with success in maintaining BP over 6 months, we believe that careful selection of eligible patients may increase success in stopping antihypertensive medications.	We couldn't find specific reasons why some patients were able to control their blood pressure for 6 months, but we think choosing the right patients carefully might help more people stop taking high blood pressure medication.
Q37	A10	36593518	Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication in young to middle-aged adults: a prospective, single-group, intervention study	13	Also, continuous emotional support might be essential in maintaining patients' off-medication.	Continuous emotional support is important to help patients manage their condition without relying on medication.
Q38	A1	16432852	Correlation of transfusion volume to change in hematocrit	1	"While it has generally been accepted that a 3% change in hematocrit is equivalent to a 1-""unit"" loss of blood, few studies have been published to actually document this."	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:It's often believed that a 3% change in hematocrit (the amount of red blood cells in your blood) is equal to losing 1 unit of blood, but not many studies have confirmed this.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand, and also defined ""hematocrit"" to help readers who might not be familiar with the term."
Q38	A1	16432852	Correlation of transfusion volume to change in hematocrit	2	A more complete understanding of this correlation would be helpful in estimating blood loss from changes in hematocrit in patients sustaining hemorrhage as well as in those receiving transfusions.	A clearer understanding of how hematocrit and blood loss are related would help doctors estimate how much blood is lost when patients are bleeding or receiving blood transfusions.
Q38	A1	16432852	Correlation of transfusion volume to change in hematocrit	3	In this retrospective study, we analyzed the post-transfusion alterations in hematocrit from 61 independent transfusions in 48 different pelvic fracture patients (age range, 16-62 years).	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:We looked back at the changes in blood thickness after patients received blood transfusions. We studied 61 transfusions given to 48 patients with broken pelvis bones, aged 16-62 years.I made the following changes:- ""retrospective study"" was simplified to ""looked back"" to convey the same meaning in simpler terms.- ""post-transfusion alterations in hematocrit"" was rephrased as ""changes in blood thickness"" to avoid using technical terms. Hematocrit refers to the proportion of red blood cells in the blood, and changes in it can be described as changes in blood thickness.- ""independent transfusions"" was removed as it's not crucial to understanding the main idea of the sentence.- ""different pelvic fracture patients"" was simplified to ""patients with broken pelvis bones"" to use more common language."
Q38	A1	16432852	Correlation of transfusion volume to change in hematocrit	4	Transfusion volumes were correlated with changes in hematocrit over 24-hr periods between the 5th and 12th hospital days, a time when there was no ongoing hemorrhage in these patients.	We looked at how much blood was given to patients and how it affected their red blood cell levels over 24 hours, from the 5th to the 12th day in the hospital, when they were no longer bleeding.
Q38	A1	16432852	Correlation of transfusion volume to change in hematocrit	5	"The average increase in hematocrit per liter of packed red blood cells transfused was 6.4% +/- 4.1%. If 1 ""unit"" of packed red blood cells is approximately 300 mL, this becomes a change of hematocrit of 1.9% +/- 1.2% per ""unit"" of blood."	"Here's a simplified version of the text: Original:  The average increase in hematocrit per liter of packed red blood cells transfused was 6.4% +/- 4.1%. If 1 ""unit"" of packed red blood cells is approximately 300 mL, this becomes a change of hematocrit of 1.9% +/- 1.2% per ""unit"" of blood.Simplified:When we transfuse a liter of red blood cells, the average increase in the concentration of red blood cells in the body is 6.4%. To put it simply, if we give one unit of blood (about 300 mL), the concentration of red blood cells increases by 1.9%."
Q38	A1	16432852	Correlation of transfusion volume to change in hematocrit	6	"The accepted correlation of about 1 ""unit"" of blood loss per 3% change in hematocrit would be valid for a 500-cc unit, but a typical unit of packed red blood cells is typically 300 cc."	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:The general rule that 1 ""unit"" of blood loss equals a 3% change in hematocrit only applies to a 500-cc unit of blood. However, a standard unit of packed red blood cells usually contains 300 cc.Or in an even simpler way:A common rule is that 1 unit of blood loss equals a 3% change in hematocrit, but this rule is based on a 500-cc unit of blood. Typically, a unit of packed red blood cells is smaller, containing 300 cc."
Q38	A1	16432852	Correlation of transfusion volume to change in hematocrit	7	In addition, the variability is substantial as indicated by our standard deviation.	"Additionally, there's a lot of variation in the results, which is shown by our calculations of standard deviation.Alternatively, In addition, the results varied significantly, as shown by our standard deviation.However, standard deviation is a term that might still be unfamiliar to non-experts. If you'd like to simplify it further:Alternatively, In addition, the results varied significantly, as shown by how spread out the numbers were.In this version, I've replaced ""standard deviation"" with a phrase that conveys the same idea in simpler terms."
Q38	A1	16432852	Correlation of transfusion volume to change in hematocrit	8	Limitations of this study include hematocrit changes due to fluid resuscitation, dehydration, age, persistent hemorrhage, and the retrospective nature of the evaluation.	"This study has some limitations, including changes in blood thickness due to receiving fluids, dehydration, age, ongoing bleeding, and the fact that we looked back at the data instead of collecting it as it happened.Note: I replaced ""hematocrit changes"" with ""changes in blood thickness"" to simplify the term, as hematocrit refers to the proportion of red blood cells in the blood."
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	1	Introduction: Surgeons and physicians encounter blood transfusions on a daily basis but a robust evidence-based strategy on indications and timing of transfusion in asymptomatic anaemic patients is yet to be determined.	Doctors often give patients blood transfusions, but there's still no clear plan based on strong evidence for when to give transfusions to patients who have low blood counts but don't show symptoms.
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	2	For judicious use of blood products, the risks inherent to packed red blood cells, the patient's co-morbidities and haemoglobin (Hb)/haematocrit levels should be considered.	To use blood products wisely, we need to think about the risks of using packed red blood cells, the patient's other health conditions, and their current blood levels (including haemoglobin and haematocrit).
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	3	This review critiques and summarises the latest available evidence on the indications for transfusions in healthy and cardiac disease patients as well as the timing of transfusions relative to surgery.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:This review looks at the latest research to understand when patients, especially those with heart conditions, should receive blood transfusions before or after surgery.I made the following changes:- Changed ""critiques and summarises"" to ""looks at"" for a simpler and more straightforward phrase.- Replaced ""indications for transfusions"" with ""when patients should receive blood transfusions"" for clarity.- Changed ""relative to surgery"" to ""before or after surgery"" to make the timing more specific and easier to understand."
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	4	Methods: An electronic literature search of the MEDLINE(®), Google Scholar™ and Trip databases was conducted for articles published in English between January 2006 and January 2015.	Here's the simplified version of the given sentence:We searched online databases (MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Trip) for articles written in English between 2006 and 2015.
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	5	Studies discussing timing and indications of transfusion in medical and surgical patients were retrieved.	We looked at research on when and why patients, both medical and surgical, need blood transfusions.
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	6	Bibliographies of studies were checked for other pertinent articles that were missed by the initial search.	We reviewed lists of sources from relevant studies to find additional articles that were not found in the first search.
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	7	Findings: Six level 1 studies (randomised controlled trials or systematic reviews) and six professional society guidelines were included in this review.	"Simplified:Our review included six top-level research studies and six expert group guidelines.(Note: I rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and more concise. I also replaced ""randomised controlled trials or systematic reviews"" with ""top-level research studies"" to make it easier to understand, and ""professional society guidelines"" with ""expert group guidelines"" to use more common terms.)"
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	8	In healthy patients without cardiac disease, a restrictive transfusion trigger of Hb 70-80g/l is safe and appropriate whereas in cardiac patients, the trigger is Hb 80-100g/l.	For patients with healthy hearts, it's safe to give blood only when their hemoglobin (Hb) level drops below 70-80g/l. However, for patients with heart conditions, blood transfusions are recommended when their Hb level falls below 80-100g/l.
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	9	The literature on timing of transfusions relative to surgery is limited.	There's not a lot of research on when to give blood transfusions in relation to surgery.
Q38	A2	26492900	An evidence-based approach to red blood cell transfusions in asymptomatically anaemic patients	10	For the studies available, preoperative transfusions were associated with a decreased incidence of subsequent transfusions and timing of transfusions did not affect the rates of colorectal cancer recurrence.	For the studies available, getting blood transfusions before surgery was linked to fewer transfusions later on, and when these transfusions were given did not impact the chances of the cancer coming back in the colon or rectum.
Q38	A3	15196315	How low is too low? Cardiac risks with anemia	1	Despite the increasing availability of data supporting more restrictive transfusion practices, the risks and benefits of transfusing critically ill patients continue to evoke controversy.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Even with more information available, doctors still disagree about the benefits and risks of giving blood transfusions to very sick patients.
Q38	A3	15196315	How low is too low? Cardiac risks with anemia	2	Past retrospective and observational studies suggested that liberal transfusion strategies were more beneficial in patients whose hematocrit levels fell below 30%.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Past studies found that giving more blood transfusions helped patients whose red blood cell count had dropped very low (below 30%).Note: I replaced ""liberal transfusion strategies"" with ""giving more blood transfusions"" to make it clearer, and ""hematocrit levels"" with ""red blood cell count"" to use more common terms."
Q38	A3	15196315	How low is too low? Cardiac risks with anemia	3	An expanding body of literature suggests that an arbitrary trigger for transfusion (the '10/30 rule') is ill advised.	More and more research shows that using a fixed rule (the '10/30 rule') to decide when to give a blood transfusion is not a good idea.Note: I rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and easier to understand, and also replaced the term 'arbitrary trigger' with 'fixed rule' to make it more relatable.
Q38	A3	15196315	How low is too low? Cardiac risks with anemia	4	A recent randomized controlled trial provided compelling evidence that similar, and in some cases better, outcomes result if a restrictive transfusion strategy is maintained.	A recent study showed that giving less blood during transfusions can lead to similar, or sometimes even better, results.
Q38	A3	15196315	How low is too low? Cardiac risks with anemia	5	The impact of this accumulating evidence on clinical practice is evident in large reports, which show that the average transfusion trigger in critically ill patients was a hemoglobin level in the range 8-8.5 g/dl.	"Here's the simplified version:The growing body of evidence has clearly changed the way doctors treat patients. Studies show that when dealing with very sick patients, doctors now tend to give blood transfusions when the patient's hemoglobin level drops to around 8-8.5 grams per deciliter.Note: I replaced ""accumulating evidence"" with ""growing body of evidence"" to make it more accessible, and ""critically ill patients"" with ""very sick patients"" for the same reason. I also broke the sentence into two to improve clarity."
Q38	A3	15196315	How low is too low? Cardiac risks with anemia	6	Based on the available evidence, transfusion in the critically ill patient without active ischemic heart disease should generally be withheld until the hemoglobin level falls to 7 g/dl.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Based on the available evidence, for very ill patients without an active heart condition, blood transfusions should usually be delayed until their hemoglobin level drops to 7 g/dl.Here's a breakdown of the simplifications made:- ""Critically ill patient"" is rephrased as ""very ill patients"" for clarity.- ""Active ischemic heart disease"" is rephrased as ""an active heart condition"" to use more common terms.- The sentence structure remains largely the same, but the wording is adjusted for easier understanding."
Q38	A3	15196315	How low is too low? Cardiac risks with anemia	7	Transfusions should be administered as clinically indicated for patients with acute, ongoing blood loss and those who have objective signs and symptoms of anemia despite maintenance of euvolemia.	Transfusions should be given to patients who are losing a lot of blood and those who show clear signs of anemia, such as weakness or pale skin, even if they have a normal amount of fluids in their body.
Q38	A3	15196315	How low is too low? Cardiac risks with anemia	8	The hemoglobin level at which serious morbidity or mortality occurs in critically ill patients with active ischemic heart disease is a subject of continued debate but it is likely that a set transfusion trigger will not provide an optimal risk-benefit profile in this population.	"Here's the simplified version:""The ideal blood hemoglobin level for critically ill patients with heart disease is still being discussed. A fixed level for blood transfusions might not be the best approach for these patients.""I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand, breaking it down into two simpler sentences. I also replaced the term ""morbidity or mortality"" with a more general phrase, ""serious health problems or death"", but in this case, I omitted it to make the sentence more concise and focused on the main idea."
Q38	A4	33173454	RBC Transfusion Triggers: Is There Anything New?	1	For many years, in daily clinical practice, the traditional 10/30 rule (hemoglobin 10 g/dL - hematocrit 30%) has been the most commonly used trigger for blood transfusions.	"For many years, doctors have used a simple rule to decide when to give patients a blood transfusion. This rule, called the 10/30 rule, says that if a patient's hemoglobin level (the amount of red blood cells) is 10 or lower, and their hematocrit level (the percentage of red blood cells in the blood) is 30 or lower, they may need a blood transfusion.Note: I have rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and more understandable. I have also defined the terms ""hemoglobin"" and ""hematocrit"" to make it clear what they refer to."
Q38	A4	33173454	RBC Transfusion Triggers: Is There Anything New?	2	Over the years, this approach is believed to have contributed to a countless number of unnecessary transfusions and an unknown number of overtransfusion-related deaths.	This method has likely led to many unneeded blood transfusions and possibly some deaths from receiving too much blood.
Q38	A4	33173454	RBC Transfusion Triggers: Is There Anything New?	3	Recent studies have shown that lower hemoglobin levels can safely be accepted, even in critically ill patients.	Recent studies have found that it's safe to have lower levels of hemoglobin, even in very sick patients.(Note: I've rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and easier to understand, while keeping the original meaning intact.)
Q38	A4	33173454	RBC Transfusion Triggers: Is There Anything New?	4	However, even these new transfusion thresholds are far beyond the theoretical limits of individual anemia tolerance.	Even with these new guidelines for blood transfusions, they are still higher than what the body can handle when it comes to low red blood cell counts.
Q38	A4	33173454	RBC Transfusion Triggers: Is There Anything New?	5	For this reason, almost all publications addressing the limits of acute anemia recommend physiological transfusion triggers to indicate the transfusion of erythrocyte concentrates as an alternative.	Most medical studies about acute anemia suggest that doctors should use a patient's physical condition to decide when to give them a blood transfusion, rather than relying on other methods.
Q38	A4	33173454	RBC Transfusion Triggers: Is There Anything New?	6	Although this concept appears intuitive at first glance, no solid scientific evidence supports the safety and benefit of physiological transfusion triggers to indicate the optimal time point for transfusion of allogeneic blood.	"Here's the simplified version:Although this idea seems obvious at first, there's no strong scientific proof that using a person's physical condition to decide when to give donated blood is safe or beneficial.I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and easier to understand. I also replaced some complex terms with simpler ones:- ""intuitive at first glance"" became ""seems obvious at first""- ""physiological transfusion triggers"" became ""using a person's physical condition to decide""- ""allogeneic blood"" became ""donated blood"""
Q38	A4	33173454	RBC Transfusion Triggers: Is There Anything New?	7	It is therefore imperative to continue searching for the most sensitive and specific parameters that can guide the clinician when to transfuse in order to avoid anemia-induced organ dysfunction while avoiding overtransfusion-related adverse effects.	It's essential to keep looking for the best indicators to help doctors decide when to give blood transfusions, so they can prevent anemia from damaging organs without giving too much blood and causing more harm.
Q38	A4	33173454	RBC Transfusion Triggers: Is There Anything New?	8	This narrative review discusses the concept of anemia tolerance and critically compares hemoglobin-based triggers with physiological transfusion for various clinical indications.	This review talks about how the body adapts to low blood count and compares two different approaches to treating it: relying on hemoglobin levels versus considering the body's overall needs, in different medical situations.
Q38	A5	16533277	Limitations of the hematocrit level to assess the need for red blood cell transfusion in hypovolemic anemic patients	1	Background: The transfusion trigger that physicians use to determine whether a patient requires a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is the peripheral venous hematocrit (Hct) value.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Background: Doctors use a patient's blood test results to decide if they need a red blood cell transfusion. This decision is based on the amount of red blood cells in the blood, which is measured by a test called hematocrit.Or, in an even simpler way:Background: To decide if a patient needs a blood transfusion, doctors check the patient's blood test results to see if they have enough red blood cells.
Q38	A5	16533277	Limitations of the hematocrit level to assess the need for red blood cell transfusion in hypovolemic anemic patients	2	Although this measurement is an indicator of the concentration of RBCs in the blood, it does not reveal the RBC volume, plasma volume, or total blood volume, nor does it give any indication of whether the patient is hypovolemic, normovolemic, or hypervolemic.	This measurement helps us know how many red blood cells are in the blood, but it doesn't tell us how much blood or fluid is in the body overall. It also doesn't show if the patient has too little, too much, or just the right amount of blood and fluids.
Q38	A5	16533277	Limitations of the hematocrit level to assess the need for red blood cell transfusion in hypovolemic anemic patients	3	Study design and methods: Two patient populations were studied: 41 consecutive patients subjected to elective vascular surgery and 20 consecutive patients subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.	We looked at two groups of patients: 41 people having planned blood vessel surgery and 20 people having heart-lung bypass surgery.
Q38	A5	16533277	Limitations of the hematocrit level to assess the need for red blood cell transfusion in hypovolemic anemic patients	4	The RBC volume was measured with (51)Cr- or (99m)Tc-labeled autologous fresh RBCs, and the plasma volume and total blood volume were estimated from the measured RBC volume and the total body Hct level.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:We measured the amount of red blood cells (RBCs) by labeling some of the patient's own RBCs with a special marker. Then, we used that information to estimate the amount of fluid in the blood (plasma) and the total blood volume, based on the percentage of red blood cells in the body.Note: I've replaced technical terms and concepts with simpler language, and broken down the sentence into smaller, more manageable parts.
Q38	A5	16533277	Limitations of the hematocrit level to assess the need for red blood cell transfusion in hypovolemic anemic patients	5	Measurements made 1 to 2 and 24 hours after surgery were compared to the preoperative values for these two groups of patients.	We compared measurements taken 1-2 hours and 24 hours after surgery to the measurements taken before surgery for these two groups of patients.
Q38	A5	16533277	Limitations of the hematocrit level to assess the need for red blood cell transfusion in hypovolemic anemic patients	6	Results: During the 24-hour postoperative period, the RBC, plasma, and total blood volumes were reduced compared to the preoperative volumes.	After surgery, the amount of red blood cells, plasma, and total blood in the body was lower than before the surgery during the first 24 hours.
Q38	A5	16533277	Limitations of the hematocrit level to assess the need for red blood cell transfusion in hypovolemic anemic patients	7	These patients were hypovolemic and anemic, and their Hct values during the 24-hour postoperative period were increased by a mean of 4 to 5 volume-percent compared to values that would be expected if they were normvolemic and anemic.	These patients had low blood volume and were anemic. After surgery, their red blood cell levels increased by 4 to 5% over 24 hours, more than what would be expected if they had normal blood volume.
Q38	A5	16533277	Limitations of the hematocrit level to assess the need for red blood cell transfusion in hypovolemic anemic patients	8	Conclusions: The Hct values in hypovolemic anemic patients are elevated because the plasma volume does not increase to achieve the normovolemic anemic state.	"Conclusions: In patients with low blood volume and anemia, the Hct values are higher because their plasma volume doesn't increase enough to reach a normal level for someone with anemia.(Note: I simplified the sentence by rephrasing it in simpler terms and avoided using the term ""normovolemic"" which might be unfamiliar to some. Instead, I used the phrase ""reach a normal level for someone with anemia"" to convey the same meaning.)"
Q38	A6	32083994	Liberal Versus Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III, Noninferiority Trial	1	Purpose: Evidence regarding red blood cell (RBC) transfusion practices and their impact on hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes are poorly understood.	Simplified:Purpose: We need to better understand how giving patients red blood cells through a transfusion affects the success of a certain type of bone marrow transplant.
Q38	A6	32083994	Liberal Versus Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III, Noninferiority Trial	2	Patients and methods: We performed a noninferiority randomized controlled trial in four different centers that evaluated patients with hematologic malignancies requiring HCT who were randomly assigned to either a restrictive (hemoglobin [Hb] threshold < 70 g/L) or liberal (Hb threshold < 90 g/L) RBC transfusion strategy between day 0 and day 100.	"Here's the simplified version:Patients and methods: We conducted a study at four centers with patients who had blood cancer and needed a special treatment called HCT. We randomly divided these patients into two groups. One group received blood transfusions only when their red blood cell count was very low (below 70 g/L), while the other group received transfusions when their count was a bit higher (below 90 g/L). We did this from the day they started treatment (day 0) to 100 days later.Note: I replaced ""noninferiority randomized controlled trial"" with ""study"" to make it simpler, and ""hemoglobin"" with ""red blood cell count"" for easier understanding. I also rephrased the sentence to break it down into smaller, more manageable parts."
Q38	A6	32083994	Liberal Versus Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III, Noninferiority Trial	3	The noninferiority margin corresponds to a 12% absolute difference between groups in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) score relative to baseline.	Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:The noninferiority margin is a 12% difference in score between groups on a survey called FACT-BMT, which measures how well patients feel after bone marrow transplant, compared to how they felt at the start.Or even simpler:We're looking for a difference of 12% or less in how patients feel after a bone marrow transplant, using a survey called FACT-BMT, compared to how they felt before the treatment.

The main goal was to measure how well patients recovered and felt about their health 100 days after treatment, using a scoring system called the FACT-BMT.
Q38	A6	32083994	Liberal Versus Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III, Noninferiority Trial	5	Additional end points were collected: HRQOL by FACT-BMT score at baseline and at days 7, 14, 28, 60, and 100; transplantation-related mortality; length of hospital stay; intensive care unit admissions; acute graft-versus-host disease; Bearman toxicity score; sinusoidal obstruction syndrome; serious infections; WHO Bleeding Scale; transfusion requirements; and reactions to therapy.	Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Additional information was collected, including: - The patient's quality of life at the start and on days 7, 14, 28, 60, and 100 after treatment, - How many patients died due to complications from the transplant, - How long patients stayed in the hospital, - How many times patients needed intensive care, - Any severe reactions between the new cells and the patient's body, - The severity of side effects, - Blockage of small blood vessels in the liver, - Serious infections, - The severity of bleeding, - How many blood transfusions were needed, - And any reactions to the treatment.Note: I've avoided using rare terms or complex sentences. I've also broken down the long list into smaller, more manageable points for easier understanding.
Q38	A6	32083994	Liberal Versus Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III, Noninferiority Trial	6	Results: A total of 300 patients were randomly assigned to either restrictive-strategy or liberal-strategy treatment groups between 2011 and 2016 at four Canadian adult HCT centers.	"Here's the simplified version:Between 2011 and 2016, 300 patients at four Canadian hospitals were randomly divided into two groups: one group received limited treatment and the other group received more treatment.I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand, and I also replaced some terms:* ""randomly assigned"" became ""randomly divided""* ""restrictive-strategy"" and ""liberal-strategy"" were simplified to ""limited treatment"" and ""more treatment""* ""HCT centers"" was replaced with ""hospitals"""
Q38	A6	32083994	Liberal Versus Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III, Noninferiority Trial	7	After HCT, mean pre-transfusion Hb levels were 70.9 g/L in the restrictive-strategy group and 84.6 g/L in the liberal-strategy group (P < .0001).	Here's the simplified version of the sentence:After the transplant, the average hemoglobin levels before blood transfusions were 70.9 g/L in the group that received fewer transfusions and 84.6 g/L in the group that received more transfusions (the difference was statistically significant).

The patients in the restrictive-strategy group received fewer red blood cell units (average 2.73 units) compared to the liberal-strategy group (average 5.02 units), and this difference is statistically significant.
Q38	A6	32083994	Liberal Versus Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III, Noninferiority Trial	9	After adjusting for transfusion type and baseline FACT-BMT score, the restrictive-strategy group had a higher FACT-BMT score at day 100 (difference of 1.6 points; 95% CI, -2.5 to 5.6 points), which was noninferior compared with that of the liberal-strategy group.	"Here's the simplified version of the given sentence:After considering the type of blood transfusion and the patient's initial health score, the group that received fewer transfusions had a slightly better quality of life score (1.6 points higher) at day 100, which was just as good as the score for the group that received more transfusions.Note: - I replaced ""restrictive-strategy group"" and ""liberal-strategy group"" with ""the group that received fewer transfusions"" and ""the group that received more transfusions"" to make the terms more understandable.- I replaced ""baseline FACT-BMT score"" with ""the patient's initial health score"" to simplify the term.- I replaced ""noninferior"" with ""just as good as"" to make the comparison clearer.- I rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand, focusing on the main idea that the group with fewer transfusions had a similar quality of life score to the group with more transfusions."
Q38	A6	32083994	Liberal Versus Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III, Noninferiority Trial	10	There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between the transfusion strategies.	The two methods of giving blood transfusions had the same results in terms of patient care and recovery.
Q38	A6	32083994	Liberal Versus Restrictive Red Blood Cell Transfusion Thresholds in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: A Randomized, Open Label, Phase III, Noninferiority Trial	11	Conclusion: In patients undergoing HCT, the use of a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy threshold of 70 g/L was as effective as a threshold of 90 g/L and resulted in similar HRQOL and HCT outcomes with fewer transfusions.	Here's a simplified version of the given text:Conclusion: For patients getting a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), using a lower threshold for red blood cell transfusions (70 g/L) works just as well as a higher threshold (90 g/L). Both methods have similar results, but the lower threshold requires fewer blood transfusions.Note: I've defined the acronym HCT and explained it in simpler terms to make the text more accessible to a general audience. I've also rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise.
Q38	A7	38395758	Alternative blood transfusion triggers: a narrative review	1	Background: Anemia, characterized by low hemoglobin levels, is a global public health concern.	"Background: Anemia, a condition where the blood doesn't have enough red blood cells, is a major health issue worldwide.(Note: I replaced ""low hemoglobin levels"" with ""the blood doesn't have enough red blood cells"" to make it more understandable, as hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.)"

Q38	A9	27767984	The optimum hematocrit	1	The hematocrit (Hct) determines the oxygen carrying capacity of blood, but also increases blood viscosity and thus flow resistance.	The hematocrit is a measure that shows how well your blood carries oxygen. However, it also affects how thick your blood is, which can make it harder for blood to flow.
Q38	A9	27767984	The optimum hematocrit	2	From this dual role the concept of an optimum Hct for tissue oxygenation has been derived.	Simplified:This dual role has led to the idea that there's an ideal level of red blood cells for our body tissues to get enough oxygen.
Q38	A9	27767984	The optimum hematocrit	3	Viscometric studies using the ratio Hct/blood viscosity at high shear rate showed an optimum Hct of 50-60% for red blood cell (RBC) suspensions in plasma.	Simplified: Studies measuring blood thickness at fast flow rates found that the best mix of red blood cells in the liquid part of the blood is between 50-60%.
Q38	A9	27767984	The optimum hematocrit	4	For the perfusion of an artificial microvascular network with 5-70μm channels the optimum Hct was 60-70% for high driving pressures.	Simplified:When creating a tiny artificial network of blood vessels, the best blood concentration was 60-70% when there was a strong force pushing the blood through the tiny channels (5-70 micrometers in size).
Q38	A9	27767984	The optimum hematocrit	5	With lower shear rates or driving pressures the optimum Hct shifted towards lower values.	When the pressure or flow rate is lower, the ideal blood thickness level also decreases.
Q38	A9	27767984	The optimum hematocrit	6	In healthy, well trained athletes an increase of the Hct to supra-normal levels can increase exercise performance.	"In healthy, well-trained athletes, having higher-than-normal levels of red blood cells can improve their performance during exercise.Note: Hct is an abbreviation for hematocrit, which is the proportion of red blood cells in the blood. I've avoided using the term ""Hct"" directly and instead explained its meaning in simpler terms."
Q38	A9	27767984	The optimum hematocrit	7	These data with healthy individuals suggest that the optimum Hct for oxygen transport may be higher than the physiological range (35-40% in women, 39-50% in men).

Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:A group of experts in London worked together to create a tool that helps manage shortness of breath in a comprehensive way, from the initial diagnosis to ongoing care.
Q39	A5	28138132	Breathing SPACE-a practical approach to the breathless patient	4	"This has led to the development of the aide memoire ""Breathing SPACE"", which encompasses five key themes-smoking, pulmonary disease, anxiety/psychosocial factors, cardiac disease, and exercise/fitness."	"To help patients remember important health factors, we created a simple reminder called ""Breathing SPACE"". It stands for five key areas to focus on: Smoking, Pulmonary (lung) disease, Anxiety and mental health, Cardiac (heart) disease, and Exercise/fitness."
Q39	A5	28138132	Breathing SPACE-a practical approach to the breathless patient	5	A particular concern was to ensure that high-value interventions (smoking cessation and exercise interventions) are prioritised across the life-course and throughout the course of disease management.	Our main focus was to make sure that important actions (like quitting smoking and exercising) are a priority at every stage of life and when managing illnesses.
Q39	A5	28138132	Breathing SPACE-a practical approach to the breathless patient	6	The approach is relevant both to well people and in those with an underling diagnosis or diagnoses.	The approach is helpful for both healthy individuals and those with existing medical conditions.
Q39	A5	28138132	Breathing SPACE-a practical approach to the breathless patient	7	The inclusion of anxiety draws attention to the importance of mental health issues.	The inclusion of anxiety highlights the need to focus on mental health problems.(Note: I rephrased the sentence to make it simpler and more straightforward, while maintaining its original meaning.)
Q39	A5	28138132	Breathing SPACE-a practical approach to the breathless patient	8	Parity of esteem requires the physical health problems of people with mental illness to be addressed.	"Parity of esteem means that we should give equal importance to treating the physical health issues of people who have mental health problems.(Note: I rephrased the sentence to make it clearer and more concise, and also added a brief explanation of ""parity of esteem"" to make it easier to understand.)"
Q39	A5	28138132	Breathing SPACE-a practical approach to the breathless patient	9	The SPACE mnemonic also addresses the problem of underdiagnosis of heart disease in people with lung disease and vice versa, as well as the systematic undertreatment of these conditions where they do co-occur.	"The SPACE mnemonic also helps doctors remember to check for heart disease in people with lung disease, and vice versa, and to properly treat both conditions when they happen together.(Note: I replaced ""underdiagnosis"" with ""check for"" and ""undertreatment"" with ""properly treat"" to make it simpler, and also removed ""systematic"" as it's not necessary for the sentence to make sense)"
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	1	Background: Breathing exercises for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) aim to alter respiratory muscle recruitment, improve respiratory muscle performance and reduce dyspnoea.	"Here's a simplified version of the sentence:Background: Breathing exercises for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) help change how breathing muscles work, make them stronger, and reduce shortness of breath.Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:* ""alter respiratory muscle recruitment"" is rephrased as ""change how breathing muscles work"" to make it easier to understand.* ""improve respiratory muscle performance"" is rephrased as ""make them stronger"" to use simpler language.* ""reduce dyspnoea"" is rephrased as ""reduce shortness of breath"" to define the medical term ""dyspnoea"" in simpler terms."
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	2	Although some studies have reported positive short-term physiological effects of breathing exercises in people with COPD, their effects on dyspnoea, exercise capacity and well being are unclear.	Some studies have found that breathing exercises can help people with COPD feel better for a short time. However, it's not clear if these exercises improve their overall breathing problems, ability to exercise, or general well-being.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	3	Objectives: To determine whether breathing exercises in people with COPD have beneficial effects on dyspnoea, exercise capacity and health-related quality of life compared to no breathing exercises in people with COPD; and to determine whether there are any adverse effects of breathing exercises in people with COPD.	"Here's a simplified version of the text:Objectives: 1. To find out if breathing exercises help people with COPD breathe better, exercise more easily, and have a better quality of life compared to not doing breathing exercises.2. To see if there are any negative effects of breathing exercises in people with COPD.I replaced ""dyspnoea"" with ""breathe better"" since dyspnoea is a medical term that means shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. I also rephrased the sentence to make it easier to understand and broke it down into two clear objectives."
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	4	Search methods: The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and the PEDro database were searched from inception to October 2011.

"We chose studies that compared people with COPD who did breathing exercises with those who didn't do breathing exercises or did a different activity.Note: I simplified the sentence by removing technical terms like ""randomised parallel trials"" and rephrased it in simpler terms. I also replaced ""intervention"" with ""activity"" to make it more accessible."
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	6	Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias.	Two researchers collected and analyzed the data separately, and they also checked for any mistakes or biases.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	7	Primary outcomes were dyspnoea, exercise capacity and health-related quality of life; secondary outcomes were gas exchange, breathing pattern and adverse events.	Primary outcomes focused on shortness of breath, ability to exercise, and overall well-being. Secondary outcomes looked at how well the body used oxygen, breathing patterns, and any negative side effects.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	8	To determine whether effects varied according to the treatment used, we assessed each breathing technique separately.	To see if different treatments had different effects, we looked at each breathing method one by one.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	9	Main results: Sixteen studies involving 1233 participants with mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) 30% to 51% predicted were included.	"Main results: We looked at 16 studies that involved 1233 people with lung function that was between 30% and 51% of what's considered normal.Note: I simplified the sentence by removing technical jargon and rephrasing it in simpler terms. I also replaced ""mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1))"" with ""lung function"" to make it more accessible to a general audience."
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	10	There was a significant improvement in six-minute walk distance after three months of yoga involving pranayama timed breathing techniques (mean difference to control 45 metres, 95% confidence interval 29 to 61 metres; two studies; 74 participants), with similar improvements in single studies of pursed lip breathing (mean 50 metres; 60 participants) and diaphragmatic breathing (mean 35 metres; 30 participants).	Here's a simplified version of the given text:People who did yoga with timed breathing exercises for three months were able to walk 45 meters more in six minutes. This is a big improvement. Two studies with 74 participants showed this. Similar results were seen in other studies where people used different breathing techniques, such as pursed lip breathing (60 participants walked 50 meters more) and diaphragmatic breathing (30 participants walked 35 meters more).
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	11	Effects on dyspnoea and health-related quality of life were inconsistent across trials.	The results of the studies were mixed in terms of how they affected shortness of breath and overall well-being.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	12	Addition of computerised ventilation feedback to exercise training did not provide additional improvement in dyspnoea-related quality of life (standardised mean difference -0.03; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.49; two studies; 73 participants) and ventilation feedback alone was less effective than exercise training alone for improving exercise endurance (mean difference -15.4 minutes; 95% CI -28.1 to -2.7 minutes; one study; 32 participants).	Here's a simplified version of the provided text:Original: Addition of computerised ventilation feedback to exercise training did not provide additional improvement in dyspnoea-related quality of life (standardised mean difference -0.03; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.49; two studies; 73 participants) and ventilation feedback alone was less effective than exercise training alone for improving exercise endurance (mean difference -15.4 minutes; 95% CI -28.1 to -2.7 minutes; one study; 32 participants).Simplified:Adding computer feedback to breathing exercises didn't improve breathing problems in daily life. Also, using only computer feedback was not as helpful as exercise training alone in increasing the amount of time people could exercise (it was 15 minutes less effective).Note: - I replaced 'computerised ventilation feedback' with 'computer feedback to breathing exercises' for clarity.- I explained 'dyspnoea-related quality of life' as 'breathing problems in daily life'.- I rephrased complex statistical terms (standardised mean difference, 95% CI, mean difference) into simpler terms for easier understanding.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	13	No significant adverse effects were reported.	No serious side effects were found.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	14	Few studies reported details of allocation concealment, assessor blinding or intention-to-treat analysis.	Not many studies clearly explained how they chose which patients got which treatment, kept the researchers from knowing which group each patient was in, or analyzed all the patients they initially planned to include.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	15	Authors' conclusions: Breathing exercises over four to 15 weeks improve functional exercise capacity in people with COPD compared to no intervention; however, there are no consistent effects on dyspnoea or health-related quality of life.	"Here's a simplified version of the given sentence:Authors' conclusions: Doing breathing exercises for 4-15 weeks can help people with COPD (a lung disease) do daily activities better than not doing anything, but it doesn't seem to consistently help with shortness of breath or overall well-being.Note: I replaced ""functional exercise capacity"" with ""do daily activities better"" to make it easier to understand, and ""health-related quality of life"" with ""overall well-being"" for the same reason."
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	16	Outcomes were similar across all the breathing exercises examined.	All the breathing exercises we looked at had similar results.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	17	Treatment effects for patient-reported outcomes may have been overestimated owing to lack of blinding.	The results of the treatment on how patients feel may be incorrect because the researchers knew who was getting the treatment and who wasn't.
Q39	A6	23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	18	Breathing exercises may be useful to improve exercise tolerance in selected individuals with COPD who are unable to undertake exercise training; however, these data do not suggest a widespread role for breathing exercises in the comprehensive management of people with COPD.	Breathing exercises can help some people with COPD who can't do regular exercise, but they aren't a key part of overall treatment for most people with COPD.Note: I replaced 'exercise tolerance' with a simpler term and rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and clear. I also defined COPD as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, but in this case, it's not necessary as the context is clear.
Q39	A7	30245619	How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life: A Systematic Review on Psycho-Physiological Correlates of Slow Breathing	1	Background: The psycho-physiological changes in brain-body interaction observed in most of meditative and relaxing practices rely on voluntary slowing down of breath frequency.

This study follows a set of rules called PRISMA to ensure it is thorough and accurate.(Note: I simplified the sentence by removing technical terms and rephrasing it in simpler language. PRISMA is a specific guideline, but I didn't define it as it's not marked as a rare term in the original sentence. However, I can provide a definition if needed: PRISMA is a set of guidelines that helps researchers report their systematic reviews and meta-analyses in a clear and transparent way.)
Q39	A7	30245619	How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life: A Systematic Review on Psycho-Physiological Correlates of Slow Breathing	7	Results: The main effects of slow breathing techniques cover autonomic and central nervous systems activities as well as the psychological status.	Simplified:Results: The main effects of slow breathing techniques involve changes in the body's automatic functions, brain activity, and mental well-being.

"Slow breathing techniques can help your body relax, which affects your heart rate and breathing patterns, and also changes the way your brain works.(Note: I've replaced technical terms like ""autonomic changes"", ""Heart Rate Variability"", ""Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia"", and ""Central Nervous System activity modifications"" with simpler explanations to make the sentence easier to understand.)"
Q39	A7	30245619	How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life: A Systematic Review on Psycho-Physiological Correlates of Slow Breathing	9	EEG studies show an increase in alpha and a decrease in theta power.	"EEG studies show an increase in normal brain activity and a decrease in abnormal brain activity.Note: I replaced ""alpha"" with ""normal brain activity"" and ""theta"" with ""abnormal brain activity"" to make it more understandable for a non-medical person. Alpha brain waves are typically associated with a normal, relaxed state, while theta brain waves can be associated with abnormal brain activity, such as in certain sleep disorders or neurological conditions."
Q39	A7	30245619	How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life: A Systematic Review on Psycho-Physiological Correlates of Slow Breathing	10	Anatomically, the only available fMRI study highlights increased activity in cortical (e.g., prefrontal, motor, and parietal cortices) and subcortical (e.g., pons, thalamus, sub-parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal gray, and hypothalamus) structures.	Here's the simplified text:Original: Anatomically, the only available fMRI study highlights increased activity in cortical (e.g., prefrontal, motor, and parietal cortices) and subcortical (e.g., pons, thalamus, sub-parabrachial nucleus, periaqueductal gray, and hypothalamus) structures.Simplified:Looking at the brain's structure, one study using fMRI found increased activity in certain areas, including the outer brain layer (like the parts controlling movement, feelings, and body sensations) and deeper brain areas (like those handling emotions, sensations, and body functions).Note: I replaced the complex terms with simpler explanations and rephrased the sentence to make it more understandable.
Q39	A7	30245619	How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life: A Systematic Review on Psycho-Physiological Correlates of Slow Breathing	11	Psychological/behavioral outputs related to the abovementioned changes are increased comfort, relaxation, pleasantness, vigor and alertness, and reduced symptoms of arousal, anxiety, depression, anger, and confusion.

They may also feel more energetic and alert, while experiencing fewer symptoms of stress, anxiety, sadness, anger, and confusion.
Q39	A7	30245619	How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life: A Systematic Review on Psycho-Physiological Correlates of Slow Breathing	12	Conclusions: Slow breathing techniques act enhancing autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility in a scenario of mutual interactions: we found evidence of links between parasympathetic activity (increased HRV and LF power), CNS activities (increased EEG alpha power and decreased EEG theta power) related to emotional control and psychological well-being in healthy subjects.	"Here's the simplified version:Conclusions: Deep, slow breathing can improve how our brain, body, and emotions work together. We found that slow breathing is linked to better emotional control and mental well-being in healthy people. This happens because slow breathing affects the part of our nervous system that helps us relax (parasympathetic activity) and changes brain activity in a way that promotes calmness and reduces stress.Note: I replaced some technical terms with simpler explanations:- ""autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility"" became ""how our brain, body, and emotions work together""- ""parasympathetic activity"" became ""the part of our nervous system that helps us relax""- ""HRV and LF power"" were removed as they are technical terms that aren't essential for understanding the main point- ""CNS activities"" became ""brain activity""- ""EEG alpha power"" and ""EEG theta power"" were replaced with ""changes brain activity in a way that promotes calmness and reduces stress"" to simplify the explanation"
Q39	A7	30245619	How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life: A Systematic Review on Psycho-Physiological Correlates of Slow Breathing	13	Our hypothesis considers two different mechanisms for explaining psychophysiological changes induced by voluntary control of slow breathing: one is related to a voluntary regulation of internal bodily states (enteroception), the other is associated to the role of mechanoceptors within the nasal vault in translating slow breathing in a modulation of olfactory bulb activity, which in turn tunes the activity of the entire cortical mantle.	Our hypothesis looks at two ways that controlling slow breathing affects our body and mind. First, it involves being aware of and controlling our internal bodily states (this is called being aware of what's happening inside our body). Second, it involves special sensors in the nose that help our brain understand slow breathing, which then affects how our brain processes smells and other information.
