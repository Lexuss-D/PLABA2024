15902691	Muscle cramps are a common problem characterized by a sudden, painful, involuntary contraction of muscle.	Muscle cramps are a common problem represented by sudden, painful, involuntary muscle contractions.			    **Objective**: Simplify the provided text by:    1. Rephrasing complex sentences for clarity.    2. Replacing or defining rarely-used terms.    **Guidelines**:    - For sentences that seem complex, rephrase them in simpler terms.    - If you encounter unfamiliar or rare words, either replace them with a commonly known synonym or provide a concise definition.    Note: In the training samples, complex sentences are flagged with `<rephrase>` and rare terms with `<rare>`. However, these tokens won't appear in testing samples. You'll need to recognize and address such complexities independently.    **Examples**:    1.    **Original**:    Furthermore, the circumference of thighs was measured to assess the <rare>postoperative swelling<rare>.    A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged between 27 to 65 years, without any recent hypertensive treatment, were included.    <rephrase>The tongue often obstructs the upper respiratory tract, especially in comatose patients or those with cardiopulmonary arrest.<rephrase>    **Simplified**:    Additionally, we measured thigh sizes to check for swelling after surgery.    444 patients, aged 27-65 with high blood pressure and no recent treatment, were studied.

You'll need to recognize and address such complexities independently.    **Examples**:    1.    **Original**:    Furthermore, the circumference of thighs was measured to assess the <rare>postoperative swelling<rare>.    A total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged between 27 to 65 years, without any recent hypertensive treatment, were included.    <rephrase>The tongue often obstructs the upper respiratory tract, especially in comatose patients or those with cardiopulmonary arrest.<rephrase>    **Simplified**:    Additionally, we measured thigh sizes to check for swelling after surgery.    444 patients, aged 27-65 with high blood pressure and no recent treatment, were studied.    The tongue can block breathing, mostly seen in unconscious people or those who've had a sudden heart stoppage.    Your task: Apply these guidelines to simplify the provided texts.    Now simplify the following sentence: It is important to note that a painful contraction that is limited to a specific area does not mean that the cause of the cramp is necessarily local.
